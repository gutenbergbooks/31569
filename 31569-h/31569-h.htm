<h3>A TALE: FOUNDED UPON EVENTS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF VENICE.</h3>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>BY W. GILMORE SIMMS.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>It was a glad day in Venice. The eve of the feast
of the Purification had arrived, and all those maidens
of the Republic, whose names had been written in the
"Book of Gold," were assembled with their parents,
their friends and lovers&mdash;a beautiful and joyous
crowd&mdash;repairing, in the gondolas provided by the
Republic, to the church of San Pietro de Castella, at
Olivolo, which was the residence of the Patriarch.
This place was on the extreme verge of the city, a
beautiful and isolated spot, its precincts almost
without inhabitants, a ghostly and small priesthood
excepted, whose grave habits and taciturn seclusion
seemed to lend an additional aspect of solitude to the
neighborhood. It was, indeed, a solitary and sad-seeming
region, which, to the thoughtless and unmeditative,
might be absolutely gloomy. But it was
not the less lovely as a place suited equally for the
picturesque and the thoughtful; and, just now, it was
very far from gloomy or solitary. The event which
was in hand was decreed to enliven it in especial
degree, and, in its consequences, to impress its characteristics
on the memory for long generations after.
It was the day of St. Mary's Eve&mdash;a day set aside
from immemorial time for a great and peculiar festival.
All, accordingly, was life and joy in the sea
republic. The marriages of a goodly company of
the high-born, the young and the beautiful, were to
be celebrated on this occasion, and in public, according
to the custom. Headed by the Doge himself,
Pietro Candiano, the city sent forth its thousands.
The ornamented gondolas plied busily from an early
hour in the morning, from the city to Olivolo; and
there, amidst music and merry gratulations of friends
and kindred, the lovers disembarked. They were
all clad in their richest array. Silks, which caught
their colors from the rainbow, and jewels that had
inherited, even in their caverns, their beauties from
the sun and stars, met the eye in all directions.
Wealth had put on all its riches, and beauty, always
modest, was not satisfied with her intrinsic loveliness.
All that could delight the eye, in personal
decorations and nuptial ornaments, was displayed to
the eager gaze of curiosity, and, for a moment, the
treasures of the city were transplanted to the solitude
and waste.</p>

<p>But gorgeous and grand as was the spectacle, and
joyous as was the crowd, there were some at the
festival, some young, throbbing hearts, who, though
deeply interested in its proceedings, felt any thing
but gladness. While most of the betrothed thrilled
only with rapturous anticipations that might have
been counted in the strong pulsations that made the
bosom heave rapidly beneath the close pressure of
the virgin zone, there were yet others, who felt only
that sad sinking of the heart which declares nothing
but its hopelessness and desolation. There were
victims to be sacrificed as well as virgins to be made
happy, and girdled in by thousands of the brave and
goodly&mdash;by golden images and flaunting banners, and
speaking symbols&mdash;by music and by smiles&mdash;there
were more hearts than one that longed to escape
from all, to fly away to some far solitude, where the
voices of such a joy as was now present could vex
the defrauded soul no more. As the fair procession
moved onward and up through the gorgeous avenues
of the cathedral to the altar-place, where stood the
venerable Patriarch in waiting for their coming, in
order to begin the solemn but grateful rites, you
might have marked, in the crowding column, the face
of one meek damsel, which declared a heart very far
removed from hope or joyful expectation. Is that
tearful eye&mdash;is that pallid cheek&mdash;that lip, now so
tremulously convulsed&mdash;are these proper to one
going to a bridal, and that her own? Where is her
anticipated joy? It is not in that despairing vacancy
of face&mdash;not in that feeble, faltering, almost fainting
footstep&mdash;not, certainly, in any thing that we behold
about the maiden, unless we seek it in the rich and
flaming jewels with which she is decorated and
almost laden down; and these no more declare for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
her emotions than the roses which encircle the neck
of the white lamb, as it is led to the altar and the
priest. The fate of the two is not unlike, and so also
is their character. Francesca Ziani is decreed for a
sacrifice. She was one of those sweet and winning,
but feeble spirits, which know how to submit only.
She has no powers of resistance. She knows that
she is a victim; she feels that her heart has been
wronged even to the death, by the duty to which it
is now commanded; she feels that it is thus made
the cruel but unwilling instrument for doing a mortal
wrong to the heart of another; but she lacks the
courage to refuse, to resist, to die rather than submit.
Her nature only teaches her submission; and this is
the language of the wo-begone, despairing glance&mdash;but
one&mdash;which she bestows, in passing up the aisle,
upon one who stands beside a column, close to her progress,
in whose countenance she perceives a fearful
struggle, marking equally his indignation and his grief.</p>

<p>Giovanni Gradenigo was one of the noblest cavaliers
of Venice&mdash;but nobleness, as we know, is
not always, perhaps not often, the credential in behalf
of him who seeks a maiden from her parents.
He certainly was not the choice of Francesca's sire.
The poor girl was doomed to the embraces of one
Ulric Barberigo, a man totally destitute of all nobility,
that alone excepted which belonged to wealth. This
shone in the eyes of Francesca's parents, but failed
utterly to attract her own. She saw, through the
heart's simple, unsophisticated medium, the person
of Giovanni Gradenigo only. Her sighs were given
to him, her loathings to the other. Though meek
and finally submissive, she did not yield without a
remonstrance, without mingled tears and entreaties,
which were found unavailing. The ally of a young
damsel is naturally her mother, and when she fails
her, her best human hope is lost. Alas! for the poor
Francesca! It was her mother's weakness, blinded
by the wealth of Ulric Barberigo, that rendered the
father's will so stubborn. It was the erring mother
that wilfully beheld her daughter led to the sacrifice,
giving no heed to the heart which was breaking,
even beneath its heavy weight of jewels. How completely
that mournful and desponding, that entreating
and appealing glance to her indignant lover, told her
wretched history. There he stood, stern as well as
sad, leaning, as if for support, upon the arm of his
kinsman, Nicolo Malapieri. Hopeless, helpless, and
in utter despair, he thus lingered, as if under a strange
and fearful fascination, watching the progress of the
proceedings which were striking fatally, with every
movement, upon the sources of his own hope and
happiness. His resolution rose with his desperation,
and he suddenly shook himself free from his friend.</p>

<p>"I will not bear this, Nicolo," he exclaimed, "I
must not suffer it without another effort, though it
be the last."</p>

<p>"What would you do, Giovanni," demanded his
kinsman, grasping him by the wrist as he spoke, and
arresting his movement.</p>

<p>"Shall I see her thus sacrificed&mdash;delivered to
misery and the grave! Never! they shall not so
lord it over true affections to their loss and mine.
Francesca was mine&mdash;is mine&mdash;even now, in the
very sight of Heaven. How often hath she vowed
it! Her glance avows it now. My lips shall as
boldly declare it again; and as Heaven has heard
our vows, the church shall hear them. The Patriarch
shall hear. Hearts must not be wronged&mdash;Heaven
must not thus be defrauded. That selfish, vain woman,
her mother&mdash;that mercenary monster, miscalled
her father, have no better rights than mine&mdash;none
half so good. They shall hear me. Stand by me,
Nicolo, while I speak!"</p>

<p>This was the language of a passion, which, however
true, was equally unmeasured and imprudent.
The friend of the unhappy lover would have held
him back.</p>

<p>"It is all in vain, Giovanni! Think! my friend,
you can do nothing now. It is too late; nor is there
any power to prevent this consummation. Their
names have been long since written in the 'Book of
Gold,' and the Doge himself may not alter the destiny!"</p>

<p>"The Book of Gold!" exclaimed the other. "Ay,
the 'Bride of Gold!' but we shall see!" And he again
started forward. His kinsman clung to him.</p>

<p>"Better that we leave this place, Giovanni. It
was wrong that you should come. Let us go. You
will only commit some folly to remain."</p>

<p>"Ay! it is folly to be wronged, and to submit to it,
I know! folly to have felt and still to feel! folly,
surely, to discover, and to live after the discovery,
that the very crown that made life precious is lost
to you forever! What matter if I should commit
this folly! Well, indeed, if they who laugh at the
fool, taste none of the wrath that they provoke."</p>

<p>"This is sheer madness, Giovanni."</p>

<p>"Release me, Nicolo."</p>

<p>The kinsman urged in vain. The dialogue, which
was carried on in under tones, now enforced by
animated action, began to attract attention. The
procession was moving forward. The high anthem
began to swell, and Giovanni, wrought to the highest
pitch of frenzy by the progress of events, and by
the opposition of Nicolo, now broke away from all
restraint, and hurried through the crowd. The circle,
dense and deep, had already gathered closely about
the altar-place, to behold the ceremony. The desperate
youth made his way through it. The crowd
gave way at his approach, and under the decisive
pressure of his person. They knew his mournful
history&mdash;for when does the history of love's denial
and defeat fail to find its way to the world's curious
hearing. Giovanni was beloved in Venice. Such
a history as his and Francesca's was sure to beget
sympathy, particularly with all those who could find
no rich lovers for themselves or daughters, such as
Ulric Barberigo. The fate of the youthful lovers
drew all eyes upon the two. A tearful interest in the
event began to pervade the assembly, and Giovanni
really found no such difficulty as would have attended
the efforts of any other person to approach the sacred
centre of the bridal circle. He made his way directly
for the spot where Francesca stood. She felt his
approach and presence by the most natural instincts,
though without ever daring to lift her eye to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
person. A more deadly paleness than ever came
over her, and as she heard the first sounds of his
voice, she faltered and grasped a column for support.
The Patriarch, startled by the sounds of confusion,
rose from the sacred cushions, and spread his hands
over the assembly for silence; but as yet he failed to
conceive the occasion for commotion. Meanwhile,
the parents and relatives of Francesca had gathered
around her person, as if to guard her from an enemy.
Ulric Barberigo, the millionaire, put on the aspect of
a man whose word was law on 'change. He, too,
had his retainers, all looking daggers at the intruder.
Fortunately for Giovanni, they were permitted to
wear none at these peaceful ceremonials. Their
looks of wrath did not discourage the approach of
our lover. He did not seem, indeed, to see them, but
gently putting them by, he drew near to the scarcely
conscious maiden. He lifted the almost lifeless hand
from her side, and pressing it within both his own,
a proceeding which her mother vainly endeavored
to prevent, he addressed the maiden with all that
impressiveness of tone which declares a stifled but
still present and passionate emotion in the heart.
His words were of a touching sorrow.</p>

<p>"And is it thus, my Francesca, that I must look
upon thee for the last time? Henceforth are we to be
dead to one another? Is it thus that I am to hear that,
forgetful of thy virgin vows to Gradenigo, thou art
here calling Heaven to witness that thou givest
thyself and affections to another?"</p>

<p>"Not willingly, O! not willingly, Giovanni, as I
live! I have not forgotten&mdash;alas! I cannot forget
that I have once vowed myself to thee. But I
pray thee to forget, Giovanni. Forget me and forgive&mdash;forgive!"</p>

<p>Oh! how mournfully was this response delivered.
There was a dead silence through the assembly; a
silence which imposed a similar restraint even upon
the parents of the maiden, who had showed a desire
to arrest the speaker. They had appealed to the
Patriarch, but the venerable man was wise enough
to perceive that this was the last open expression of
a passion which must have its utterance in some
form, and if not this, must result in greater mischief.
His decision tacitly sanctioned the interview as we
have witnessed. It was with increased faltering,
which to the bystanders seemed almost fainting, that
the unhappy Francesca thus responded to her lover.
Her words were little more than whispers, and his
tones, though deep, were very low and subdued, as
if spoken while the teeth were shut. There was
that in the scene which brought forward the crowd
in breathless anxiety to hear, and the proud heart of
the damsel's mother revolted at an exhibition in
which her position was by no means a grateful one.
She would have wrested, even by violence, the hand
of her daughter from the grasp of Giovanni; but he
retained it firmly, the maiden herself being scarcely
conscious that he did so. His eye was sternly fixed
upon the mother, as he drew Francesca toward himself.
His words followed his looks:</p>

<p>"Have you not enough triumphed, lady, in thus
bringing about your cruel purpose, to the sacrifice of
two hearts&mdash;your child's no less than mine. Mine
was nothing to you&mdash;but hers! what had she done
that you should trample upon hers? This hast thou
done! Thou hast triumphed! What would'st thou
more? Must she be denied the mournful privilege
of saying her last parting with him to whom she
vowed herself, ere she vows herself to another!
For shame, lady; this is a twofold and a needless
tyranny!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the more gentle and sympathizing
spirits around looked upon the stern mother with
faces of the keenest rebuke and indignation. Giovanni
once more addressed himself to the maiden.</p>

<p>"And if you do not love this man, my Francesca,
why is it that you so weakly yield to his solicitings?
Why submit to this sacrifice at any instance? Have
they strength to subdue thee?&mdash;has he the art to ensnare
thee?&mdash;canst thou not declare thy affections
with a will? What magic is it that they employ
which is thus superior to that of love?&mdash;and what is
thy right&mdash;if heedless of the affections of <i>thy</i> heart&mdash;to
demand the sacrifice of <i>mine</i>? Thou hadst it
in thy keeping, Francesca, as I fondly fancied I had
thine!"</p>

<p>"Thou hadst&mdash;thou hast!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Francesca, my child!" was the expostulating
exclamation of the mother; but it failed, except for a
single instant, to arrest the passionate answer of the
maiden.</p>

<p>"Hear me and pity, Giovanni, if you may not forgive!
Blame me for my infirmity&mdash;for the wretched
weakness which has brought me to this defeat of thy
heart&mdash;this desolation of mine&mdash;but do not doubt that
I have loved thee&mdash;that I shall ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay!" commanded the imperious father.</p>

<p>"What is it thou wouldst say, Francesca? Beware!"
was the stern language of the mother.</p>

<p>The poor girl shrunk back in trembling. The
brief impulse of courage which the address of her
lover, and the evident sympathy of the crowd, had
imparted, was gone as suddenly as it came. She
had no more strength for the struggle; and as she
sunk back nerveless, and closed her eyes as if fainting
under the terrible glances of both her parents,
Giovanni dropped her hand from his grasp. It now
lay lifeless at her side, and she was sustained from
falling by some of her sympathizing companions.
The eyes of the youth were bent upon her with a
last look.</p>

<p>"It is all over then," he exclaimed. "Thy hope,
unhappy maiden, like mine, must perish because of
thy weakness. Yet there will be bitter memories
for this," he exclaimed, and his eye now sought the
mother&mdash;"bitter, bitter memories! Francesca, farewell!
Be happy if thou canst!"</p>

<p>She rushed toward him as he moved away, recovering
all her strength for this one effort. A single
and broken sentence&mdash;"Forgive me, O forgive!"&mdash;escaped
her lips, as she sunk senseless upon the floor.
He would have raised her, but they did not suffer him.</p>

<p>"Is this not enough, Giovanni?" said his friend
reproachfully. "Seest thou not that thy presence but
distracts her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou art right, Nicolo; let us go. I am myself
choking&mdash;undo me this collar!&mdash;There! Let us
depart."</p>

<p>The organ rolled its anthem&mdash;a thousand voices
joined in the hymn to the Virgin, and as the sweet
but painful sounds rushed to the senses of the youth
he darted through the crowd, closely followed by his
friend. The music seemed to pursue him with
mockery. He rushed headlong from the temple, as
if seeking escape from some suffocating atmosphere
in the pure breezes of heaven, and hurried forward
with confused and purposeless footsteps. The moment
of his disappearance was marked by the partial
recovery of Francesca. She unclosed her eyes,
raised her head and looked wildly around her. Her
lips once more murmured his name.</p>

<p>"Giovanni!"</p>

<p>"He is gone," was the sympathizing answer from
more than one lip in the assembly; and once more
she relapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
<br />

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Giovanni Gradenigo was scarcely more conscious
than the maiden when he left. He needed all the
guidance of his friend.</p>

<p>"Whither?" asked Nicolo Malapiero.</p>

<p>"What matter! where thou wilt," was the reply.</p>

<p>"For the city then;" and his friend conducted him
to the gondola which was appointed to await them.
In the profoundest silence they glided toward the city.
The gondola stopped before the dwelling of Nicolo,
and he, taking the arm of the sullen and absent Giovanni
within his own, ascended the marble steps,
and was about to enter, when a shrill voice challenged
their attention by naming Giovanni.</p>

<p>"How now, signor," said the stranger. "Is it
thou? Wherefore hast thou left Olivolo? Why
didst thou not wait the bridal."</p>

<p>The speaker was a strange, dark-looking woman,
in coarse woollen garments. She hobbled as she
walked, assisted by a heavy staff, and seeming to
suffer equally from lameness and from age. Her thin
depressed lips, that ever sunk as she spoke into the
cavity of the mouth, which, in the process of time,
had been denuded of nearly all its teeth; her yellow
wrinkled visage, and thin gray hairs, that escaped
from the close black cap which covered her head,
declared the presence of very great age. But her
eye shone still with something even more lively and
impressive than a youthful fire. It had a sort of
spiritual intensity. Nothing, indeed, could have
been more brilliant, or, seemingly, more unnatural.
But hers was a nature of which we may not judge
by common laws. She was no common woman,
and her whole life was characterized by mystery.
She was known in Venice as the "Spanish Gipsy;"
was supposed to be secretly a Jewess, and had only
escaped from being punished as a sorceress by her
profound and most exemplary public devotions. But
she was known, nevertheless, as an enchantress, a
magician, a prophetess; and her palmistry, her magic,
her symbols, signs and talismans, were all held
in great repute by the superstitious and the youthful
of the ocean city. Giovanni Gradenigo himself,
obeying the popular custom, had consulted her; and
now, as he heard her voice, he raised his eyes, and
started forward with the impulse of one who suddenly
darts from under the gliding knife of the assassin.
Before Nicolo could interfere, he had leapt down the
steps, and darted to the quay from which the old
woman was about to step into a gondola. She
awaited his coming with a smile of peculiar meaning,
as she repeated her inquiry:</p>

<p>"Why are not you at Olivolo?"</p>

<p>He answered the question by another, grasping
her wrist violently as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Did you not promise that she should wed with
me&mdash;that she should be mine&mdash;mine only?"</p>

<p>"Well!" she answered calmly, without struggling
or seeking to extricate her arm from the strong hold
which he had taken upon it.</p>

<p>"Well! and even now the rites are in progress
which bind her to Ulric Barberigo!"</p>

<p>"She will never wed Ulric Barberigo," was the
quiet answer. "Why left you Olivolo?" she continued.</p>

<p>"Could I remain and look upon these hated nuptials&mdash;could
I be patient and see her driven like a
sheep to the sacrifice? I fled from the spectacle, as
if the knife of the butcher were already in my own
heart."</p>

<p>"You were wrong; but the fates have spoken, and
their decrees are unchangeable. I tell you I have
seen your bridal with Francesca Ziani. No Ulric
weds that maiden. She is reserved for you alone.
You alone will interchange with her the final vows
before the man of God. But hasten, that this may
find early consummation. I have seen other things!
Hasten&mdash;but hasten not alone, nor without your
armor! A sudden and terrible danger hangs over
San Pietro di Castella, and all within its walls.
Gather your friends, gather your retainers. Put on
the weapons of war and fly thither with all your
speed. I see a terrible vision, even now, of blood
and struggle! I behold terrors that frighten even
me! Your friend is a man of arms. Let your war-galleys
be put forth, and bid them steer for the Lagune
of Caorlo. There will you win Francesca, and
thenceforth shall you wear her&mdash;you only&mdash;so long
as it may be allowed you to wear any human joy!"</p>

<p>Her voice, look, manner, sudden energy, and the
wild fire of her eyes, awakened Giovanni to his
fullest consciousness. His friend drew nigh&mdash;they
would have conferred together, but the woman interrupted
them.</p>

<p>"You would deliberate," said she, "but you have
no time! What is to be done must be done quickly.
It seems wild to you, and strange, and idle, what I
tell you, but it is nevertheless true; and if you heed
me not now bitter will be your repentance hereafter.
You, Giovanni, will depart at least. Heed not your
friend&mdash;he is too cold to be successful. He will
always be safe, and do well, but he will do nothing
further. Away! if you can but gather a dozen friends
and man a single galley, you will be in season. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the time is short. I hear a fearful cry&mdash;the cry of
women&mdash;and the feeble shriek of Francesca Ziani is
among the voices of those who wail with a new terror!
I see their struggling forms, and floating garments,
and disheveled hair! Fly, young men, lest
the names of those whom Venice has written in her
Book of Gold, shall henceforth be written in a Book
of Blood!"</p>

<p>The reputation of the sybil was too great in Venice
to allow her wild predictions to be laughed at. Besides,
our young Venetians&mdash;Nicolo no less than
Giovanni, in spite of what the woman had spoken
touching his lack of enthusiasm&mdash;were both aroused
and eagerly excited by her speech. Her person dilated
as she spoke&mdash;her voice seemed to come up
from a fearful depth, and went thrillingly deep into
the souls of the hearers. They were carried from
their feet by her predictions. They prepared to obey
her counsels. Soon had they gathered their friends
together, enough to man three of the fastest galleys
of the city. Their prows were turned at once toward
the Lagune of Caorlo, whither the woman had directed
them. She, meanwhile, had disappeared, but
the course of her gondola lay for Olivolo.</p>
<br />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>It will be necessary that we should go back in our
narrative but a single week before the occurrence of
these events. Let us penetrate the dim and lonesome
abode on the confines of the "Jewish Quarter,"
but not within it, where the "Spanish Gipsy" delivered
her predictions. It is midnight, and still she
sits over her incantations. There are vessels of
uncouth shape and unknown character before her.
Huge braziers lie convenient, on one of which,
amidst a few coals, a feeble flame may be seen to
struggle. The atmosphere is impregnated with a
strong but not ungrateful perfume, and through its
vapors objects appear with some indistinctness. A
circular plate of brass or copper&mdash;it could not well
be any more precious metal&mdash;rests beneath the eye
and finger of the woman. It is covered with strange
and mystic characters, which she seems busily to
explore, as if they had a real significance in her
mind. She evidently united the highest departments
of her art with its humblest offices; and possessed
those nobler aspirations of the soul, which, during
the middle ages, elevated in considerable degree the
professors of necromancy. But our purpose is not
now to determine her pretensions. We have but to
exhibit and to ascertain a small specimen of her skill
in the vulgar business of fortune-telling&mdash;an art
which will continue to be received among men, to
a greater or less extent, so long as they shall possess
a hope which they cannot gratify, and feel a superstition
which they cannot explain. Our gipsy expects
a visiter. She hears his footstep. The door
opens at her bidding and a stranger makes his appearance.
He is a tall and well made man, of stern
and gloomy countenance, which is half concealed
beneath the raised foldings of his cloak. His beard,
of enormous length, is seen to stream down upon his
breast; but his cheek is youthful, and his eye is
eagerly and anxiously bright. But for a certain repelling
something in his glance, he might be considered
a very handsome man&mdash;perhaps by many
persons he was thought so. He advanced with an
air of dignity and power. His deportment and manner&mdash;and
when he spoke, his voice&mdash;all seemed to
denote a person accustomed to command. The
woman did not look up as he approached&mdash;on the
contrary she seemed more intent than ever in the examination
of the strange characters before her. But
a curious spectator might have seen that a corner of
her eye, bright with an intelligence that looked more
like cunning than wisdom, was suffered to take in
all of the face and person of the visiter that his muffling
costume permitted to be seen.</p>

<p>"Mother," said the stranger, "I am here."</p>

<p>"You say not who you are," answered the woman.</p>

<p>"Nor shall say," was the abrupt reply of the
stranger. "That, you said, was unnecessary to
your art&mdash;to the solution of the questions that I
asked you."</p>

<p>"Surely," was the answer. "My art, that promises
to tell thee of the future, would be a sorry
fraud could it not declare the present&mdash;could it not
say who thou art, as well as what thou seekest."</p>

<p>"Ha! and thou knowest!" exclaimed the other,
his hand suddenly feeling within the folds of his
cloak, as he spoke, as if for a weapon, while his eye
glared quickly around the apartment, as if seeking
for a secret enemy.</p>

<p>"Nay, fear nothing," said the woman calmly. "I
care not to know who thou art. It is not an object
of my quest, otherwise it would not long remain a
secret to me."</p>

<p>"It is well! mine is a name that must not be
spoken among the homes of Venice. It would make
thee thyself to quail couldst thou hear it spoken."</p>

<p>"Perhaps! but mine is not the heart to quail at
many things, unless it be the absolute wrath of Heaven.
What the violence or the hate of man could
do to this feeble frame, short of death, it has already
suffered. Thou knowest but little of human cruelty,
young man, though thy own deeds be cruel!"</p>

<p>"How knowest thou that my deeds are cruel?"
was the quick and passionate demand, while the form
of the stranger suddenly and threateningly advanced.
The woman was unmoved.</p>

<p>"Saidst thou not that there was a name that might
not be spoken in the homes of Venice? Why should
thy very name make the hearts of Venice to quail unless
for thy deeds of cruelty and crime? But I see
further. I see it in thine eyes that thou art cruel. I
hear it in thy voice that thou art criminal. I know,
even now, that thy soul is bent on deeds of violence
and blood, and the very quest that brings thee to me
now is less the quest of love than of that wild and
selfish passion which so frequently puts on his habit."</p>

<p>"Ha! speak to me of that! This damsel, Francesca
Ziani! 'Tis of her that I would have thee
speak. Thou saidst that she should be mine, yet lo!
her name is written in the "Book of Gold," and she
is allotted to this man of wealth, this Ulric Barberigo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"She will never be the wife of Ulric Barberigo."</p>

<p>"Thou saidst she should be mine."</p>

<p>"Nay; I said not that."</p>

<p>"Ha!&mdash;but thou liest!"</p>

<p>"No! Anger me not, young man! I am slower,
much slower to anger than thyself&mdash;slower than most
of those who still chafe within this mortal covering&mdash;yet
am I mortal like thyself, and not wholly free from
such foolish passions as vex mortality. Chafe me,
and I will repulse thee with scorn. Annoy me, and
I close upon thee the book of fate, leaving thee to
the blind paths which thy passions have ever moved
thee to take."</p>

<p>The stranger muttered something apologetically.</p>

<p>"Make me no excuses. I only ask thee to forbear
and submit. I said not that Francesca Ziani should
be <i>thine</i>! I said only that I beheld her in thy
arms."</p>

<p>"And what more do I ask!" was the exulting
speech of the stranger, his voice rising into a sort of
outburst, which fully declared the ruffian, and the
sort of passions by which he was governed.</p>

<p>"If that contents thee, well!" said the woman,
coldly, her eye perusing with a seeming calmness
the brazen plate upon which the strange characters
were inscribed.</p>

<p>"That, then, thou promisest still?" demanded the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt see for thyself," was the reply. Thus
speaking the woman slowly arose and brought forth
a small chafing-dish, also of brass or copper, not
much larger than a common plate. This she placed
over the brazier, the flame of which she quickened
by a few smart puffs from a little bellows which lay
beside her. As the flame kindled, and the sharp, red
jets rose like tongues on either side of the plate, she
poured into it something like a gill of a thick tenacious
liquid, that looked like, and might have been,
honey. Above this she brooded for awhile with her
eyes immediately over the vessel; and the keen ear
of the stranger, quickened by excited curiosity, could
detect the muttering of her lips, though the foreign
syllables which she employed were entirely beyond
his comprehension. Suddenly, a thick vapor went
up from the dish. She withdrew it from the brazier
and laid it before her on the table. A few moments
sufficed to clear the surface of the vessel, the vapor
arising and hanging languidly above her head.</p>

<p>"Look now for thyself and see!" was her command
to the visiter; she herself not deigning a glance
upon the vessel, seeming thus to be quite sure of
what it would present, or quite indifferent to the
result. The stranger needed no second summons.
He bent instantly over the vessel, and started back
with undisguised delight.</p>

<p>"It is she!" he exclaimed. "She droops! whose
arm is it that supports her&mdash;upon whose breast is it
that she lies&mdash;who bears her away in triumph?"</p>

<p>"Is it not thyself?" asked the woman, coldly.</p>

<p>"By Hercules, it is! She is mine! She is in my
arms! She is on my bosom! I have her in my
galley! She speeds with me to my home! I see it
all, even as thou hast promised me!"</p>

<p>"I promise thee nothing. I but show thee only
what is written."</p>

<p>"And when and how shall this be effected?"</p>

<p>"How, I know not," answered the woman, "this
is withheld from me. Fate shows what her work is
only as it appears when done, but not the manner of
the doing."</p>

<p>"But when will this be?" was the question.</p>

<p>"It must be ere she marries with Ulric Barberigo,
for him she will never marry."</p>

<p>"And it is appointed that he weds with her on the
day of St. Mary's Eve. That is but a week from
hence, and the ceremony takes place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At Olivolo."</p>

<p>"Ha! at Olivolo!" and a bright gleam of intelligence
passed over the features of the stranger, from
which his cloak had by this time entirely fallen.
The woman beheld the look, and a slight smile, that
seemed to denote scorn rather than any other emotion,
played for a moment over her shriveled and
sunken lips.</p>

<p>"Mother," said the stranger, "must all these
matters be left to fate?"</p>

<p>"That is as thou wilt."</p>

<p>"But the eye of a young woman may be won&mdash;her
heart may be touched&mdash;so that it shall be easy
for fate to accomplish her designs. I am young;
am indifferently well fashioned in person, and have
but little reason to be ashamed of the face which
God has given me. Beside, I have much skill in
music, and can sing to the guitar as fairly as most of
the young men of Venice. What if I were to find my
way to the damsel&mdash;what if I play and sing beneath
her father's palace? I have disguises, and am wont
to practice in various garments; I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Thou mayest do as thou wilt. It is doubtless as
indifferent to the fates what thou doest, as it will be
to me. Thou hast seen what I have shown&mdash;I can
no more. I am not permitted to counsel thee. I
am but a voice; thou hast all that I can give thee."</p>

<p>The stranger lingered still, but the woman ceased
to speak, and betrayed by her manner that she desired
his departure. Thus seeing, he took a purse from
his bosom and laid it before her. She did not seem
to notice the action, nor did she again look up
until he was gone. With the sound of his retreating
footsteps, she put aside the brazen volume of strange
characters which seemed her favorite study, and her
lips slowly parted in soliloquy,</p>

<p>"Ay! thou exultest, fierce ruffian that thou art, in
the assurance that fate yields herself to thy will!
Thou shall, indeed, have the maiden in thy arms,
but it shall profit thee nothing; and that single
triumph shall exact from thee the last penalties
which are sure to follow on the footsteps of a trade
like thine. Thou thinkest that I know thee not, as
if thy shallow masking could baffle eyes and art like
mine; but I had not shown thee thus much, were I
not in possession of yet further knowledge&mdash;did I not
see that this lure was essential to embolden thee to
thy own final overthrow. Alas! that in serving the
cause of innocence, in saving the innocent from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
harm, we cannot make it safe in happiness. Poor
Francesca, beloved of three, yet blest with neither!
Thou shalt be wedded, yet be no bride; shall gain all
that thy fond young heart craveth, yet gain nothing!
Be spared the embraces of him thou loathest, yet
rest in his arms whom thou hast most need to fear,
and shalt be denied, even when most assured, the
only embrace which might bring thee blessings!
Happy at least that thy sorrows shall not last thee long&mdash;their
very keenness and intensity being thy security
from the misery which holds through years like mine!"</p>

<p>Let us leave the woman of mystery&mdash;let us once
more change the scene. Now pass we to the pirate's
domain at Istria, a region over which, at the period
of our narrative, the control of Venice was feeble,
exceedingly capricious, and subject to frequent vicissitudes.
At this particular time, it was maintained by
the fiercest band of pirates that ever swept the
Mediterranean with their bloody prows.</p>
<br />

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>It was midnight when the galley of the chief
glided into the harbor of Istria. The challenge of
the sentinel was answered from the vessel, and she
took her place beside the shore, where two other
galleys were at anchor. Suddenly her sails descended
with a rattle; a voice hailed throughout the
ship, was answered from stem to stern, and a deep
silence followed. The fierce chief of the pirates,
Pietro Barbaro, the fiercest, strongest, wisest, yet
youngest of seven brothers, all devoted to the same
fearful employment, strode in silence to his cabin.
Here, throwing himself upon a couch, he prepared
rather to rest his limbs than to sleep. He had thoughts
to keep him wakeful. Wild hopes, and tenderer
joys than his usual occupations offered, were gleaming
before his fancy. The light burned dimly in his
floating chamber, but the shapes of his imagination
rose up before his mind's eye not the less vividly
because of the obscurity in which he lay. Thus
musing over expectations of most agreeable and
exciting aspect, he finally lapsed away in sleep.</p>

<p>He was suddenly aroused from slumber by a rude
hand that lay heavily on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked of the intruder.</p>

<p>"Gamba," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Thou, brother!"</p>

<p>"Ay," continued the intruder; "and here are
all of us."</p>

<p>"Indeed! and wherefore come you? I would
sleep&mdash;I am weary. I must have rest."</p>

<p>"Thou hast too much rest, Pietro," said another
of the brothers. "It is that of which we complain&mdash;that
of which we would speak to thee now."</p>

<p>"Ha! this is new language, brethren! Answer
me&mdash;perhaps I am not well awake; am I your captain,
or not?"</p>

<p>"Thou art&mdash;the fact seems to be forgotten by no
one but thyself. Though the youngest of our mother's
children, we made thee our leader."</p>

<p>"For what did ye this, my brothers, unless that I
might command ye?"</p>

<p>"For this, in truth, and this only, did we confer
upon thee this authority. Thou hadst shown thyself
worthy to command&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"Thy skill&mdash;thy courage&mdash;thy fortitude&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In brief, ye thought me best fitted to command
ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I command ye hence! Leave me, and let
me rest!"</p>

<p>"Nay, brother, but this cannot be;" was the reply
of another of the intruders. "We must speak with
thee while the night serves us, lest thou hear worse
things with the morrow. Thou art, indeed, our
captain; chosen because of thy qualities of service,
to conduct and counsel us; but we chose thee not
that thou shouldst sleep! Thou wert chosen that our
enterprises might be active and might lead to frequent
profit."</p>

<p>"Has it not been so?" demanded the chief.</p>

<p>"For a season it was so, and there was no complaint
of thee."</p>

<p>"Who now complains?"</p>

<p>"Thy people&mdash;all!"</p>

<p>"And can ye not answer them?"</p>

<p>"No! for we ourselves need an answer! We,
too, complain."</p>

<p>"Of what complain ye?"</p>

<p>"That our enterprises profit us nothing."</p>

<p>"Do ye not go forth in the galleys? Lead ye not,
each of you, an armed galley? Why is it that your
enterprises profit ye nothing?"</p>

<p>"Because of the lack of our captain."</p>

<p>"And ye can do nothing without me; and because
ye are incapable, I must have no leisure for myself."</p>

<p>"Nay, something more than this, Pietro. Our
enterprises avail us nothing, since you command
that we no longer trouble the argosies of Venice.
Venice has become thy favorite. Thou shieldest
her only, when it is her merchants only who should
give us spoil. This, brother, is thy true offence.
For this we complain of thee; for this thy people complain
of thee. They are impoverished by thy new-born
love for Venice, and they are angry with thee.
Brother, their purpose is to depose thee?"</p>

<p>"Ha! and ye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are men as well as brethren. We cherish
no such attachment for Venice as that which seems
to fill thy bosom. When the question shall be taken
in regard to thy office, our voices shall be against
thee, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a pause. It was broken by the chief.</p>

<p>"Well, speak out. What are your conditions?"</p>

<p>"Unless thou shalt consent to lead us on a great
enterprise against the Venetians. Hearken to us,
brother Pietro. Thou knowest of the annual festival
at Olivolo, when the marriage takes place of all
those maidens, whose families are favorites of the
Signiory, and whose names are written in the "Book
of Gold" of the Republic."</p>

<p>The eyes of the pirate chief involuntarily closed
at the suggestion, but his head nodded affirmatively.
The speaker continued.</p>

<p>"It is now but a week when this festival takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
place. On this occasion assemble the great, the
noble and the wealthy of the sea city. Thither they
bring all that is gorgeous in their apparel, all that is
precious among their ornaments and decorations.
Nobility and wealth here strive together which shall
most gloriously display itself. Here, too, is the beauty
of the city&mdash;the virgins of Venice&mdash;the very choice
among her flocks. Could there be prize more fortunate?
Could there be prize more easy of attainment?
The church of San Pietro di Castella permits
no armed men within its holy sanctuaries. There
are no apprehensions of peril; the people who gather
to the rites are wholly weaponless. They can offer
no defense against our assault; nor can this be foreseen?
What place more lonely than Olivolo?
Thither shall we repair the day before the festival,
and shelter ourselves from scrutiny. At the moment
when the crowd is greatest, we will dart upon our
prey. We lack women; we desire wealth. Shall
we fail in either, when we have in remembrance
the bold deeds of our ancient fathers, when they
looked with yearning on the fresh beauties of the
Sabine virgins? These Venetian beauties are our
Sabines. Thou, too, if the bruit of thy followers do
thee no injustice, thou, too, hast been overcome by
one of these. She will doubtless be present at this
festival. Make her thine, and fear not that each of
thy brethren will do justice to his tastes and thine
own. Here, now, thou hast all. Either thou agreest
to that which thy people demand, or the power departs
from thy keeping. Fabio becomes our leader!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. At length the pirate-chief
addressed his brethren.</p>

<p>"Ye have spoken! ye threaten, too! This power,
of which ye speak, is precious in your eyes. I value
it not a zecchino; and wert thou to depose me to-morrow,
I should be the master of ye in another
month, did it please me to command a people so
capricious. But think not, though I speak to ye in
this fashion, that I deny your demand. I but speak
thus to show ye that I fear you not. I will do as ye
desire; but did not your own wishes square evenly
with mine own, I should bide the issue of this struggle,
though it were with knife to knife."</p>

<p>"It matters not how thou feelest, or what movest
thee, Pietro, so that thou dost as we demand. Thou
wilt lead us to this spoil?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"It is enough. It will prove to thy people that
they are still the masters of the Lagune&mdash;that they
are not sold to Venice."</p>

<p>"Leave me now."</p>

<p>The brethren took their departure. When they
had gone, the chief spoke in brief soliloquy, thus:</p>

<p>"Verily, there is the hand of fate in this. Methinks
I see the history once more, even as I beheld
it in the magic liquor of the Spanish Gipsy. Why
thought I not of this before, dreaming vainly like an
idiot boy, as much in love with his music as himself,
who hopes by the tinkle of his guitar to win
his beauty from the palace of her noble sire, to the
obscure retreats of his gondola. These brethren shall
not vex me. They are but the creatures of a fate!"</p>
<br />

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>Let us now return to Olivolo, to the altar-place of
the church of San Pietro di Castella, and resume the
progress of that strangely mingled ceremonial&mdash;mixed
sunshine and sadness&mdash;which was broken by
the passionate conduct of Giovanni Gradenigo. We
left the poor, crushed Francesca, in a state of unconsciousness,
in the arms of her sympathizing kindred.
For a brief space the impression was a painful one
upon the hearts of the vast assembly; but as the deep
organ rolled its ascending anthems, the emotion subsided.
The people had assembled for pleasure and
an agreeable spectacle; and though sympathizing,
for a moment, with the pathetic fortunes of the sundered
lovers, quite as earnestly as it is possible for
mere lookers-on to do, they were not to be disappointed
in the objects for which they came. The
various shows of the assemblage&mdash;the dresses, the
jewels, the dignitaries, and the beauties&mdash;were quite
enough to divert the feelings of a populace, at all
times notorious for its levities, from a scene which,
however impressive at first, was becoming a little
tedious. Sympathies are very good and proper
things; but the world seldom suffers them to occupy
too much of its time. Our Venetians did not pretend
to be any more humane than the rest of the great
family; and the moment that Francesca had fainted,
and Giovanni had disappeared, the multitude began
to express their impatience of any further delay by
all the means in their possession. There was no
longer a motive to resist their desires, and simply
reserving the fate of the poor Francesca to the last,
or until she should sufficiently recover to be fully
conscious of the sacrifice which she was about to
make, the ceremonies were begun. There was a
political part to be played by the Doge, in which
the people took particular interest; and to behold
which, indeed, was the strongest reason of their impatience.
The government of Venice, as was remarked
by quaint and witty James Howell, was a
compound thing, mixed of all kinds of governments,
and might be said to be composed of "a
<i>grain</i> of monarchy, a <i>dose</i> of democracy, and a
<i>dram</i>, if not an <i>ounce</i> of optimacy." It was in regard
to this <i>dose</i> of democracy, that the government
annually assigned marriage portions to twelve young
maidens, selected from the great body of the people,
of those not sufficiently opulent to secure husbands,
or find the adequate means for marriage, without
this help. To bestow these maidens upon their
lovers, and with them the portions allotted by the
state, constituted the first, and in the eyes of the
masses, the most agreeable part of the spectacle.
The Doge, on this occasion, who was the thrice renowned
Pietro Candiano, "did his spiriting gently,"
and in a highly edifying manner. The bishop bestowed
his blessings, and confirmed by the religious,
the civil rites, which allied the chosen couples. To
these succeeded the <i>voluntary</i> parties, if we may
thus presume upon a distinction between the two
classes, which we are yet not sure that we have a
right to make. The high-born and the wealthy, couple
after couple, now approached the altar, to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the final benediction which committed them to hopes
of happiness which it is not in the power of any
priesthood to compel. No doubt there was a great
deal of hope among the parties, and we have certainly
no reason to suppose that happiness did not
follow in every instance.</p>

<p>But there is poor Francesca Ziani. It is now her
turn. Her cruel parents remain unsubdued and unsoftened
by her deep and touching sorrows. She is
made to rise, to totter forward to the altar, scarcely
conscious of any thing, except, perhaps, that the
worthless, but wealthy, Ulric Barberigo is at her
side. Once more the mournful spectacle restores to
the spectators all their better feelings. They perceive,
they feel the cruelty of that sacrifice to which
her kindred are insensible. In vain do they murmur
"shame!" In vain does she turn her vacant, wild,
but still expressive eyes, expressive because of
their very soulless vacancy, to that stern, ambitious
mother, whose bosom no longer responds to her child
with the true maternal feeling. Hopeless of help
from that quarter, she lifts her eyes to Heaven, and,
no longer listening to the words of the holy man,
she surrenders herself only to despair.</p>

<p>Is it Heaven that hearkens to her prayer? Is it
the benevolent office of an angel that bursts the doors
of the church at the very moment when she is called
upon to yield that response which dooms her to
misery forever? To her ears, the thunders which
now shook the church were the fruits of Heaven's
benignant interposition. The shrieks of women on
every hand&mdash;the oaths and shouts of fierce and insolent
authority&mdash;the clamors of men&mdash;the struggles
and cries of those who seek safety in flight or entreat
for mercy&mdash;suggest no other idea to the wretched
Francesca, than that she is saved from the embraces
of Ulric Barberigo. She is only conscious that,
heedless of her, and of the entreaties of her mother,
he is the first to endeavor selfishly to save himself by
flight. But her escape from Barberigo is only the
prelude to other embraces. She knows not, unhappy
child! that she is an object of desire to another, until
she finds herself lifted in the grasp of Pietro Barbaro,
the terrible chief of the Istrute pirates. He and his
brothers have kept their pledges to one another, and
they have been successful in their prey. Their fierce
followers have subdued to submission the struggles
of a weaponless multitude, who, with horror and
consternation, behold the loveliest of their virgins,
the just wedded among them, borne away upon the
shoulders of the pirates to their warlike galleys.
Those who resist them perish. Resistance was
hopeless. The fainting and shrieking women, like
the Sabine damsels, are hurried from the sight of
their kinsmen and their lovers, and the Istrute
galleys are about to depart with their precious freight.
Pietro Barbaro, the chief, stands with one foot upon
his vessel's side and the other on the shore. Still insensible,
the lovely Francesca lies upon his breast. At
this moment the skirt of his cloak is plucked by a bold
hand. He turns to meet the glance of the Spanish Gypsy.
The old woman leered on him with eyes that seemed
to mock his triumph, even while she appealed to it.</p>

<p>"Is it not even as I told thee&mdash;as I showed thee?"
was her demand.</p>

<p>"It is!" exclaimed the pirate-chief, as he flung her
a purse of gold. "Thou art a true prophetess. Fate
has done her work!"</p>

<p>He was gone; his galley was already on the deep,
and he himself might now be seen kneeling upon the
deck of the vessel, bending over his precious conquest,
and striving to bring back the life into her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed!" muttered the Spanish Gipsy, "thou
hast had her in thy arms, but think not, reckless
robber that thou art, that fate has <i>done</i> its work.
The work is but <i>begun</i>. Fate has kept its word to
thee; it is thy weak sense that fancied she had nothing
more to say or do!"</p>

<p>Even as she spoke these words, the galleys of
Giovanni Gradenigo were standing for the Lagune of
Caorlo. He had succeeded in collecting a gallant
band of cavaliers who tacitly yielded him the command.
The excitement of action had served, in some
measure, to relieve the distress under which he
suffered. He was no longer the lover, but the man;
nor the man merely, but the leader of men. Giovanni
was endowed for this by nature. His valor
was known. It had been tried upon the Turk. Now
that he was persuaded by the Spanish Gipsy, whom
all believed and feared, that a nameless and terrible
danger overhung his beloved, which was to be met
and baffled only by the course he was pursuing, his
whole person seemed to be informed by a new spirit.
The youth, his companions, wondered to behold the
change. There was no longer a dreaminess and
doubt about his words and movements, but all was
prompt, energetic, and directly to the purpose.
Giovanni was now the confident and strong man.
Enough for him that there <i>was</i> danger. Of this he
no longer entertained a fear. Whether the danger
that was supposed to threaten Francesca, was still
suggestive of a hope&mdash;as the prediction of the Spanish
Gipsy might well warrant&mdash;may very well be questioned.
It was in the very desperation of his hope,
perhaps, that his energies became at once equally
well-ordered and intense. He prompted to their
utmost the energies of others. He impelled all his
agencies to their best exertions. Oar and sail were
busy without intermission, and soon the efforts of the
pursuers were rewarded. A gondola, bearing a
single man, drifted along their path. He was a
fugitive from Olivolo, who gave them the first definite
idea of the foray of the pirates. His tidings,
rendered imperfect by his terrors, were still enough
to goad the pursuers to new exertions. Fortune
favored the pursuit. In their haste the pirate galleys
had become entangled in the lagune. The keen eye
of Giovanni was the first to discover them. First
one bark, and then another, hove in sight, and soon
the whole piratical fleet were made out, as they
urged their embarrassed progress through the intricacies
of the shallow waters.</p>

<p>"Courage, bold hearts!" cried Giovanni to his
people; "they are ours! We shall soon be upon
them. They cannot now escape us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The eye of the youthful leader brightened with the
expectation of the struggle. His exulting, eager
voice declared the strength and confidence of his
soul, and cheered the souls of all around him. The
sturdy oarsmen "gave way" with renewed efforts.
The knights prepared their weapons for the conflict.
Giovanni <i>signaled</i> the other galleys by which his
own was followed.</p>

<p>"I am for the red flag of Pietro Barbaro himself.
I know his banner. Let your galleys grapple with
the rest. Cross their path&mdash;prevent their flight, and
bear down upon the strongest. Do your parts, and
fear not but we shall do ours."</p>

<p>With these brief instructions, our captain led the
way with the Venetian galleys. The conflict was
at hand. It came. They drew nigh and hailed the
enemy. The parley was a brief one. The pirates
could hope no mercy, and they asked none. But
few words, accordingly, were exchanged between
the parties, and these were not words of peace.</p>

<p>"Yield thee to the mercy of St. Mark!" was the
stern summons of Giovanni, to the pirate-chief.</p>

<p>"St. Mark's mercy has too many teeth!" was the
scornful reply of the pirate. "The worthy saint
must strike well before Barbaro of Istria sues to him
for mercy.</p>

<p>With the answer the galleys grappled. The Venetians
leapt on board of the pirates, with a fury that
was little short of madness. Their wrath was terrible.
Under the guidance of the fierce Giovanni, they
smote with an unforgiving vengeance. It was in
vain that the Istrutes fought as they had been long
accustomed. It needed something more than customary
valor to meet the fury of their assailants.
All of them perished. Mercy now was neither asked
nor given. Nor, as it seemed, did the pirates care
to live, when they beheld the fall of their fearful
leader. He had crossed weapons with Giovanni
Gradenigo, in whom he found his fate. Twice,
thrice, the sword of the latter drove through the
breast of the pirate. Little did his conqueror conjecture
the import of the few words which the dying
chief gasped forth at his feet, his glazed eyes striving
to pierce the deck, as if seeking some one within.</p>

<p>"I have, indeed, had thee in my arms, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no more&mdash;death finished the sentence!
The victory was complete, but Giovanni was
wounded. Pietro Barbaro was a fearful enemy.
He was conquered, it is true, but he had made his
mark upon his conqueror. He had bitten deep before
he fell.</p>

<p>The victors returned with their spoil. They brought
back the captured brides in triumph. That same
evening preparations were made to conclude the
bridal ceremonies which the morning had seen so
fearfully arrested. With a single exception, the
original distribution of the "brides" was persevered
in. That exception, as we may well suppose, was
Francesca Ziani. It was no longer possible for her
unnatural parents to withstand the popular sentiment.
The Doge himself, Pietro Candiano, was particularly
active in persuading the reluctant mother to submit
to what was so evidently the will of destiny. But
for the discreditable baseness and cowardice of Ulric
Barberigo, it is probable she never would have
yielded. But his imbecility and unmanly terror in
the moment of danger, had been too conspicuous.
Even his enormous wealth could not save him from
the shame that followed; and however unwillingly,
the parents of Francesca consented that she should
become the bride of Giovanni, as the only proper
reward for the gallantry which had saved her, and so
many more, from shame.</p>

<p>But where was Giovanni? His friends have been
dispatched for him; why comes he not? The maid,
now happy beyond her hope, awaits him at the altar.
And still he comes not. Let us go back for a moment
to the moment of his victory over the pirate-chief.
Barbaro lies before him in the agonies of death.
His sword it is which has sent the much dreaded
outlaw to his last account. But he himself is wounded&mdash;wounded
severely, but not mortally by the man
whom he has slain. At this moment he received a
blow from the axe of one of the brothers of Barbaro.
He had strength left barely to behold and to shout his
victory, when he sunk fainting upon the deck of the
pirate vessel. His further care devolved upon his
friend, Nicolo, who had followed his footsteps closely
through all the paths of danger. In a state of stupor
he lies upon the couch of Nicolo, when the aged
prophetess, the "Spanish Gipsy," appeared beside
his bed.</p>

<p>"He is called," she said. "The Doge demands
his presence. They will bestow upon him his bride,
Francesca Ziani. You must bear him thither."</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head.</p>

<p>"It may arouse him," said Nicolo. "We can
bear him thither on a litter, so that he shall feel
no pain."</p>

<p>"It were something to wake him from this apathy,"
mused the surgeon. "Be it as thou wilt."</p>

<p>Thus, grievously wounded, was the noble Giovanni
borne into the midst of the assembly for each member
of which he had suffered and done so much. The
soft music which played around, awakened him.
His eyes unclosed to discover the lovely Francesca,
tearful, but hopeful, bending fondly over him. She
declared herself his. The voice of the Doge confirmed
the assurance; and the eye of the dying man
brightened into the life of a new and delightful consciousness.
Eagerly he spoke; his voice was but a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Make it so, I pray thee, that I may live!"</p>

<p>The priest drew nigh with the sacred unction.
The marriage service was performed, and the hands
of the two were clasped in one.</p>

<p>"Said I not?" demanded an aged woman, who approached
the moment after the ceremonial, and whose
face was beheld by none but him whom she addressed.
"She is thine!"</p>

<p>The youth smiled, but made no answer. His hand
drew that of Francesca closer. She stooped to his
kiss, and whispered him, but he heard her not.
With the consciousness of the sweet treasure that he
had won after such sad denial, the sense grew conscious
no longer&mdash;the lips of the youth were sealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
for ever. The young Giovanni, the bravest of the
Venetian youth, lay lifeless in the embrace of the
scarcely more living Francesca. It was a sad day,
after all, in Venice, since its triumph was followed
by so great a loss; but the damsels of the ocean city
still declare that the lovers were much more blest in
this fortune, than had they survived for the embrace
of others less beloved.</p>

<p>[The touching and romantic incident upon which
this little tale is founded, has been made use of by
Mr. Rogers, in his poem of "Italy." It is one of
those events which enrich and enliven, for romance,
the early histories of most states and nations that
ever arrive at character and civilization. It occurs
in the first periods of Venetian story, about 932, under
the Doge Candiano II. I have divided my sketch
into <i>five</i> parts, having originally designed a dramatic
piece with the same divisions. That I have since
thought proper to write the tale in the narrative and
not the dramatic form, is not because of any insusceptibility
of the material to such uses. I still think
that the story, as above given, might easily and successfully
be dramatized, giving it a mixed character&mdash;that
of the melo-dramatic opera, and only softening
the close to a less tragical denouement.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>If to be seated, on a bright winter's day, before a
glowing fire of anthracite, with one's feet on the
fender, and one's form half-buried in the depths of a
cushioned easy-chair, holding the uncut pages of the
last novel, be indeed the practical definition of happiness,
then Emma Leslie was to be envied as she
sat thus cosily, one afternoon, listening to an animated
discussion going on between an elderly lady
and gentleman on the opposite side of the fire-place.
The discussion ran on a grave subject&mdash;a very grave
subject&mdash;one which has puzzled the heads of wise
men, and turned the wits of weak ones. But though
the argument grew every moment more close and
earnest, the fair listener had the audacity to laugh, in
clear, silvery tones, that told there was not one
serious thought in her mind, as she said,</p>

<p>"Nay, good uncle, a truce to these generalities.
If, as I imagine, all this talk upon woman's rights
and woman's duties has been for my special edification,
pray be more explicit and tell me what part I
am to play in the general reform you propose?"</p>

<p>The gentleman thus addressed looked up at this
interruption, and replied in a tone slightly acidified,</p>

<p>"For your benefit also has been your Aunt Mary's
clear exposition of what woman may and should be.
Perhaps you will profit as much by her suggestions
as you seem to do by mine."</p>

<p>"Do not give me up as incorrigible just as I am
coming to be taught how to be good," said Emma,
with mock gravity. "With regard to this subject of
temperance, of which you were just speaking, and
upon which you say woman has so much influence,
what shall I do? How can I reclaim the drunkard
while I move in a circle where the degraded creatures
are not admitted. They will not be influenced
by a person who has no feelings or sympathies in
common with them, even were it proper for me to
descend to their level in order to help them."</p>

<p>"That may be. The tide of gay and fashionable
life sweeps over and buries in oblivion the ruin its
forms and ceremonies help to make. Yet there are
some you might reach. Some who are just beginning
to sink, and whom men cannot influence because
they are too proud to own their danger."</p>

<p>"How less likely, then, would a woman be to influence
them," replied Emma. "You know how
men try to conceal their vices and foibles from us."</p>

<p>"True, but yet men do not suspect the weaker sex
of doubting their power to reform themselves, and
are therefore more willing to be advised and persuaded
by them to abandon their bad habits, which
have not yet become fixed vices. Woman's intuitive
perception of what should be said, and the right moment
to say it, men rarely possess; and this gives
your sex a superiority over ours in the work of reform.
Yet, alas! how often is this influence employed
to lure the wandering feet further and further
from the path of virtue."</p>

<p>"Beware, uncle, I'll have no slander," replied
Emma, half vexed.</p>

<p>"It is not slander. How often have I seen you,
Emma, with smiles and gay words, sipping that
which, however harmless to you, is poison to some
of your thoughtless companions. Were you pure in
word and deed from all contamination in that behalf,
how different would be your influence. Yet you refused
to join the Temperance Society I am endeavoring
to establish in our neighborhood."</p>

<p>"But you know," said Emma, with a proud curl
of her ruby lip, "that I am in no danger. Why
should my name be mixed with the common herd?"</p>

<p>"That is false pride, unworthy a true-hearted
woman. To refuse to aid a reforming movement
that will assist thousands, simply because it will not
benefit you, because you do not need its help. I did
not think you so selfish."</p>

<p>"I am not selfish. You shall not call me such
ugly names," replied the niece, striving to turn the
conversation from the serious turn it had taken.
"You know very well it is only my humility that
speaks. I don't think women have any right to
form societies and make laws. All that honor and
glory I am willing to leave to men, and only ask for
my sex the liberty of doing as they please in the
humble station assigned to them by the 'lords of
creation.' You may rule the world, and give orders,
and we will&mdash;break them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said her uncle, rising to go, "you will
break them, indeed&mdash;break all laws of justice, honor
and humanity in your giddy course."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Emma, rising and holding his hands
in hers as he was about to leave the room,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Put down your hat, don't take your stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now, prithee, uncle, stay.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I will not let you go thinking me so naughty and
saucy. Don't look so sober, or I shall certainly cry,
and you know you hate scenes. I am really half
convinced by your arguments, but were I to sign
the pledge, what good would it do. I have no desire
to go about with a sermon on my lips, and a frown
on my brow, to bestow on all the luckless wights
who 'touch, taste or handle.' It is not genteel to
scold, and I fancy they might think me impertinent
were I to advise. Who is there among my acquaintance
who would not resent my interference with
their habits in this respect?"</p>

<p>"There is your cousin, Edward," replied her uncle,
seating himself again. "You know well how to
lead him in your train through all kinds of fun and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
folly, perhaps you might induce him to sign the
temperance pledge."</p>

<p>"But Edward is strictly temperate. He rarely
takes even wine."</p>

<p>"True, and I don't think him in danger of becoming
less so. But his position in society gives
him great influence over the young men with whom
he associates; and some who follow his example in
refusing to sign the pledge, are unable to follow him
in controlling their appetites."</p>

<p>"There is young Saville, too," said Aunt Mary.
"It is whispered among his friends, that unless
something arrests his course, he will ere long be
ruined."</p>

<p>A flush passed over Emma's beautiful face as, in a
tone of surprise and horror, she exclaimed, "What,
George Saville! with his genius and eloquence&mdash;is he
a slave to that vice?"</p>

<p>"They say," replied her aunt, "that much of his
fiery eloquence arises from the fumes of brandy, and
the sparkling wit that makes him so delightful is
caught from the bubbles that dance on the wine-cup.
When the excitement, thus produced, passes away,
he is dull and spiritless."</p>

<p>"And will no one warn him&mdash;no one save him?"
said Emma, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Who can do it so well as yourself?" said her
uncle. "Is he not one of the worshipers at your
shrine? Of what avail is it to be young and beautiful
and wealthy, if the influence such accidents give be
not employed in the cause of truth and virtue?"</p>

<p>Emma did not reply, and her uncle left the room,
where she remained a long time in deep thought,
roused and startled by the new ideas presented to her
mind, for giddy and thoughtless as she seemed, she
possessed a mind and heart capable of deep feeling
and energetic action.</p>

<p>The same evening she was seated by the piano,
drawing thence a flood of melody, while her Cousin
Edward and George Saville stood beside her. But
the attention of the latter seemed more absorbed by
the fair musician than by the sweet sounds produced
by her flying fingers; and directing his companion's
attention to the soft brown hair that fell in long,
shining ringlets around her pure brow, and over her
snowy neck, he said, in a tone intended to reach his
ear alone,</p>

<p>"What would you give to possess one of those
curls?"</p>

<p>Low as were the words, Emma heard them, and
pausing suddenly, said, "What would <i>you</i> give?"</p>

<p>"Any thing&mdash;every thing," said the young man,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Would you give your liberty&mdash;would you bind
yourself to do my bidding?" asked the maiden, in a
tone in which playful gayety strove to hide a deeper
feeling.</p>

<p>"The liberty to disobey your will, lady, has long
been lost," replied Saville, with a glance that well-nigh
destroyed Emma's self-possession. "It were
a small matter to acknowledge it by my vow."</p>

<p>"On that condition it is yours," said Emma, while
the rich blush that mantled cheek and brow, made her
more beautiful than ever as she severed from her
queenly head one of the longest of the luxurient
tresses with which nature had adorned it.</p>

<p>"Ma belle Emma," interposed Edward as she did
this, "I cannot allow of such partiality. Let me
take the oath of allegiance and gain an equal prize."</p>

<p>"Will you dare?" replied Emma, gayly. "Will
you bow your haughty spirit to do my bidding?
Beware, for when you have vowed, you are completely
in my power."</p>

<p>"And a very tyrant you will be, no doubt, fair
queen, yet I accept the vow. Royalty needs new
disciples when there are so many deserters."</p>

<p>"Kneel, then, Cousin Edward, and you also, Mr.
Saville, and rise Knights of the Ringlet, bound to
serve in all things the will of your sovereign lady."
So saying, she placed half the ringlet on the shoulder
of each gentleman, as they knelt in mock humility
before her. Some unutterable feeling seemed to
compel Saville to <i>look</i> the thanks he would have
spoken, but Edward, with a conscious privilege,
seized her hand, and kissing it, exclaimed, as he
threw himself into "an attitude,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Thy will, and thine alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For ever and a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By sea and land, through fire and flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We promise to obey."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />


<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>About a month after, Edward and his cousin found
themselves listening to the eloquent appeals of a well
known temperance lecturer. He dwelt upon the
woes and ruins of intemperance, and the responsibility
of every one who did not do all in his power
to remedy the evil. At the close of the lecture the
pledge was passed among the audience. When it
came to where they were sitting, Emma took it, and
offering Edward her pencil, whispered, "Let the
Knight of the Ringlet perform his vow." He looked
at her inquiringly. She traced her own name beneath
those written there, and bade him do the same.
For an instant he hesitated, and was half offended
with her for the stratagem, but good sense and politeness
both forbade a refusal, and he complied.</p>

<p>It was a more delicate task to exert the same influence
over the proud and sensitive George Saville,
but at length the opportunity occurred.</p>

<p>One evening, as he mingled with the gay groups
that filled the splendid drawing-rooms of the fashionable
Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, one of his acquaintance came up,
and filling two glasses with wine that stood on the
marble side-table, offered one to him. As he was
raising it to his lips, a rose-bud fell over his shoulder
into the glass, and a voice near him said, in low,
musical tones, "Touch it not, Knight of the Ringlet,
I command you by this token;" and turning, he saw
Emma standing beside him. As she met his gaze,
she passed her delicate hand through the dark curls
that shaded her lovely face, and shaking her finger at
him impressively, was lost in the crowd. Saville
stood looking after her with a bewildered air, as if
lost in thought, until the laugh of his companion
recalled him to himself. "Excuse me," he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
putting down the glass. "You saw the spell flung
over me, I am under oath to obey the behests of
beauty."</p>

<p>Emma watched him through the evening, but he
seemed to avoid her, and appeared thoughtful and
sad. They did not meet again, until at a late hour;
she was stepping into her carriage to return home,
when suddenly he appeared at her side and assisting
her into it, entreated, "Fair queen, permit the humblest
of your most loyal subjects the honor of escorting
you to the palace." She assented, and the carriage
had no sooner started than in a voice, trembling with
earnestness, he added. "and permit me to ask if your
command this evening was merely an exercise of
power, or did a deeper meaning lie therein?"</p>

<p>"I did mean to warn you," said Emma, gently,
"that there was poison in the glass&mdash;slow, perchance,
but sure."</p>

<p>"And do you think <i>me</i> in danger, Miss Leslie?"</p>

<p>"I think all in danger who do not adopt the rule of
total abstinance; and, pardon me, if I say that with
your excitable temperament, I imagine you to be in
more than ordinary peril."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. When he spoke again
his tones were calmer.</p>

<p>"I did not imagine I could ever become a slave
to appetite. Often, while suffering from the fatigue
induced by writing, I have taken brandy, and been
revived by it. Sometimes before going to speak in
public I have felt the need of artificial stimulus to
invigorate my shattered nerves. Do you think that
improper indulgence?"</p>

<p>"Do you not find," said Emma, "that this lassitude
returns more frequently, and requires more
stimulus to overcome it than formerly?"</p>

<p>"It is true," said he, thoughtfully; "yet I often
speak with more fluency when under such excitement
than I can possibly do at other times."</p>

<p>"Once it was not so," said Emma, kindly.</p>

<p>"Very true, but this kind of life wears on my
system. I cannot get though with my public duties
without help of this kind."</p>

<p>"Does not this show," replied Emma, that you
have already somewhat impaired those noble powers
with which you are endowed. Would it not be
far nobler as well as safer to trust solely to yourself
than to depend on the wild excitement thus
induced?"</p>

<p>"It does, indeed; fool that I have been to think
myself secure. But, thank heaven! I am yet master.
I <i>can</i> control myself if I choose."</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at the door of Miss
Leslie's mansion.</p>

<p>"Let me detain you one moment," said Saville,
as they stood upon the steps, "to ask you if you
have heard others speak of this. Tell me truly," he
added, as she hesitated. "Do the public know that
I am not always master of myself?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it intimated you were injuring
yourself in this way," replied Emma, in a low voice,
doubtful how the intelligence would be received.</p>

<p>"And you," said the young man, fervently, "you
were the kind angel who interposed to save me from
the precipice over which I have well-nigh fallen. Be
assured the warning shall not be in vain. A thousand
thanks for this well-timed caution," he added, more
cheerfully, as they parted, "the Knight of the
Ringlet will not forget his vow."</p>

<p>For a few moments the joyous excitement of his
spirit continued, as he thought of the interest in him
which her conversation and actions had that evening
evinced. But when the door closed and shut her fairy
form from his sight, a shadow fell over his heart.
Other feelings arose and whispered that after all it
was but pity that actuated her. Love&mdash;would she
not rather despise his weakness that had need of such
a caution? Then came a sense of wounded pride, an
idea that his confession had humbled him before her,
and ere he reached his home he had become so deeply
desponding that he was meditating taking passage for
England, and doing a thousand other desperate things,
so that he never again might see the gentle monitress
who, he had persuaded himself, regarded him with
pity that was more akin to disgust than love.</p>

<p>A letter received the next morning calling him
into the country for a week, prevented his executing
his rash designs; but a feeling, unaccountable even
to himself, made him shun the places where he was
accustomed to meet Emma, and made him miserable,
till three or four weeks afterward, merely by accident,
he found himself seated opposite to her at a
concert. Was it fancy, or did she look sad and
thoughtful; and why did her eye roam over the
crowd, as if seeking some one it found not. So he
thought to himself, till suddenly, in their gazing, his
eyes met hers. Instantly she turned away, and then
in a moment after, gave him an earnest, inquiring
glance, full of troubled thought. At that look the
demon which tormented him vanished, and a flood
of inexpressible love filled his soul. He could not
go to her, hemmed in as he was by the audience; but
he did not cease looking at her through the evening.
In vain; she gave no second look or sign of consciousness
of his presence.</p>

<p>"She is offended with me," he soliloquized, as he
went homeward; "and no wonder. How like a fool
I have acted. I will go to her to-morrow and tell
her all."</p>

<p>In the morning he called, but others had been before
him, and the drawing-room was well supplied with
loungers. He staid as long as decency would permit;
but Miss Leslie was not at all cordial in her manner
toward him, and the "dear five hundred friends"
kept coming and going, so that no opportunity offered
for the explanation. "I will go again this evening,"
said he to himself; and so he did. Emma stood at
the window, beside a stand of magnificent plants,
whose blossoms filled the room with fragrance. The
lamps had not been lighted, and the moonlight fell
like a halo of glory around her, as she stood in sad
reverie that cast a pensive shade over her face,
usually so brilliant in its beauty. So absorbed was
she, that she did not hear the door open, and was
unconscious of Saville's presence till he was at
her side.</p>

<p>"You received me coldly, fair lady, this morning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
so that I came back to see if you are offended with
me," said he, as she turned to receive him.</p>

<p>"And I, in my turn, ask you the same question, or
else why have you absented yourself so long?"</p>

<p>"I was not offended&mdash;ah, no!" said Saville, dropping
the tone of forced gayety in which he had at
first spoken, "but can you not understand why I
have thus exiled myself? Did you not know it was
that I feared you might despise me&mdash;you from whom
more than from any one else I desired esteem, admiration&mdash;<i>love</i>."
The last word was spoken in a
lower tone, and he looked at her appealingly, as if to
ask forgiveness for having uttered it. For one instant
he met the gaze of Emma's dark blue eyes, and he
must have read something there he did not expect to
find, for the expression of his own changed into
one so hopeful and earnest that Emma's sunk beneath
its light. And when he drew Emma into a seat beside
him, and in a few rapid words told her what in
fact she knew before, how long and how well he
had loved her. I don't know what she said, for,
reader, I came away then.</p>

<p>But I do know that one morning, six months after,
some carriages went from Mr. Leslie's mansion to
the church, and came back filled with a party looking
most auspiciously happy, and that some hours after,
as Edward was conducting his Cousin Emma to a
traveling carriage, which stood at the door, he said,
"So you and Saville have changed positions, and <i>you</i>
are henceforth to obey. What a tyrant I would be,
were I in his place. Pray does this morning's act
cancel former obligations?"</p>

<p>"The contract is unbroken," said Saville, answering
for his bride, and producing a locket containing
<i>the</i> ringlet&mdash;"here is the token that renders the vow
perpetual."</p>

<h4>BY HENRY A. CLARK.</h4>

<h5>(<i>Concluded from page 196.</i>)</h5>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5><i>The Raker in a Calm.</i></h5>

<p>A long calm, usually so tiresome to sailors, but
considered most fortunate by Lieutenant Morris,
succeeded the events just narrated. He was constantly
in the society of the beautiful Julia Williams,
and the impression first made upon him by her surpassing
beauty rapidly deepened into a devoted love.
Wholly absorbed in his passion, he cared not how
long his little brig lay with flapping sails upon the
water waiting for the wind. Julia was by no means
indifferent to his addresses, so ardent and yet so respectful.
She already loved the gallant young sailor,
though she hardly even suspected it herself, yet why
did she so love the long evening walk with him upon
the deck of the brig? Why did her eye grow brighter,
and her heart beat faster, whenever he entered the
little cabin? Such feelings she had for him as she
had never felt before, though one of her beauty could
hardly have been without lovers in her native land.
She loved to hear him talk of his own home in the
far west&mdash;of the clear blue skies of America. She
even began to think that her country was wrong in
the quarrel then existing between the two nations,
though the young officer touched but lightly upon the
subject, not deeming it matter of interest to a lady's
ears. Yes, Lieutenant Morris had a strange influence
over Julia, and she wondered why it was, but
she could not be in love with him, O, no!</p>

<p>The disastrous events which had so effectually
prevented Mr. Williams from prosecuting his voyage
to the Indies were matters of deep regret to the worthy
merchant, and his brow was continually clouded
with care. Julia was not so much engrossed with
her passion for the young lieutenant that she did not
perceive this, but as she saw no way to console her
father, she only strove by her own cheerfulness to
impart a greater degree of contentment to him. As
for John, he seemed both happy and proud. He was
once more in safety, and he bore honorable wounds
to show in proof of his valor. His stories of his own
achievements when he so gallantly made his escape
from the pirate each day grew more and more marvelous.
He was especially fond of narrating this
exploit to his friend Dick Halyard, to whom he endeavored
to convey the impression that he had fought
his way overboard from the deck of the pirate, and
for want of a boat had boldly set sail upon a plank
over the dangerous deep.</p>

<p>"Crikey! Dick, if ever I get back to old Lonnon
agin, how the women will love me when I tell 'em
how I fought them bloody pirates."</p>

<p>John had never read Shakspeare, or he might have
said with Othello, that they would love him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"For the dangers I have passed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dick, who as the reader already knows was somewhat
of a wag in his way, was not at all disposed to
allow John to retain this self-conceited idea of his
own valor, and determined to convince him before
the belief got too strongly settled in his mind, that he
was as much a coward as ever.</p>

<p>With this praiseworthy intention he waited till the
middle watch of the night, when John was comfortably
snoozing in his hammock, to which he had become
somewhat accustomed. Dick suddenly awoke
him.</p>

<p>"John, roll out, the pirates are on us again."</p>

<p>John jumped from his hammock, thoroughly awakened
by the dreadful word.</p>

<p>"O lud! Dick, where can I hide myself?"</p>

<p>"Why, we must fight them off, John. You have
now a chance to get another wound to show the girls
in Lonnon. Come, be lively.</p>

<p>"O! Dick, here's a box, let me get in here."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man! take this cutlas, and here's a
pair of pistols; come, we shall be too late for them."</p>

<p>"O! Dick, I can't fight."</p>

<p>"Can't fight! What was that yarn you told me
this morning, how you killed two pirates on their
own deck, and jumped overboard followed by a
shower of balls."</p>

<p>"Dick, that was all a lie."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"I never fought in my life; I always run when
any body tried to lick me, ever since I was a little
boy."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought so, John. You can turn in again,
and snooze till daylight."</p>

<p>"What, aint there no pirates on board us?"</p>

<p>"Not a one, ha! ha! ha! I only wanted to see
how brave a fellow you were, so turn in."</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning! Dick," said John, picking
up the cutlas and brandishing it heroically, "you
don't think I 'm afraid of pirates do you?"</p>

<p>"O! no, not a bit of it."</p>

<p>"Of course I aint."</p>

<p>"I don't think you are&mdash;I only know you are."</p>

<p>"Well now, you see, Dick, taint our business to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
fight 'em if they was here; this ship belongs to the
'Mericans, and we haint got to fight for them, it's
their own look out."</p>

<p>"Turn in, John."</p>

<p>"Thunder! if this 'ere was an English ship you'd
a seen me going into 'em."</p>

<p>"John, I say, don't you tell me any thing more
about your fighting the pirates, 'cause if you do, I'll
tell the whole crew how I frightened you."</p>

<p>"Say nothing, Dick, and I wont lie to you any
more."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Dick left John to his repose, and returned to the
deck much pleased with the success of his stratagem.</p>

<p>"Confounded mean, that 'are, in Dick Halyard,"
thought John, as he tumbled into his hammock again.
"Now I never would a served him so&mdash;there aint
nothing like true friendship in this world&mdash;at any rate
there aint none out to sea&mdash;but never mind, I can tell
the story to the girls in Lonnon, if I ever get there,
and there wont be nobody to make a fool of me then&mdash;pirates,
crikey! who cares, I aint afraid of 'em."</p>

<p>And John went to sleep, dreaming that he was
sailing on a plank again, with any quantity of sharks
following in his wake.</p>

<p>After several days a fine breeze filled the sails of
the Raker; it did not come in consequence of the
vast amount of grumbling, and perhaps of swearing,
which the uneasy tars had given vent to, but from
whatever cause it filled them with joy, and every
countenance among them was lighted with pleasure.
Captain Greene had so far recovered as to be able
to reach the deck of his brig, and as his smart little
craft walked off before the wind, he sat on the
quarter-deck with a pleasant smile upon his weather-beaten
countenance, conversing with Captain Horton
and Mr. Williams. Each of the three old gentlemen
held a short pipe in his mouth, and all seemed
to be decidedly enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>"I say, Captain Greene," exclaimed the commander
of the lost merchantman, "nobody would
think our two countries were at war to see us now,"
and the worthy tar blew a long column of smoke
from his mouth and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Truly not, and it don't seem more than half
natural that we should be."</p>

<p>"Why, we English all think that the Americans
cherish feelings of hatred toward us."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it sir&mdash;there is, on the contrary, a
strong feeling of attachment among us all for our
mother country."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you fighting us for now then?"</p>

<p>"Because we think we have been wronged; your
naval officers have time and again impressed our
free-born American citizens, on board their own
craft, though it was clearly shown that they owed no
allegiance to the king."</p>

<p>"Well, if that is so, it looks wrong to be sure; I
don't know much about the war, but as an Englishman,
I am bound to believe my country is in the
right, some way or other, even if it looks otherwise."</p>

<p>"Of course, captain&mdash;at any rate, I don't believe
we shall quarrel about it. Fill up again, captain, I
see your pipe is out."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I believe I will. Mr. Williams, you
don't seem to feel as well as usual, you look a little
gloomy."</p>

<p>"My thoughts just then were running upon my
great disappointment, in being so unfortunately prevented
from proceeding to the Indies."</p>

<p>"The fortune of war, Mr. Williams," said Capt.
Horton, as he lit his pipe from the American commander's.
"It's bad, I know, and I've lost as nice
a little brig as ever sailed out of London, and don't
know as I shall ever get another, even if I ever get
home to old England again. Speaking of that, Captain
Greene, do you hold us prisoners of war, or
how?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," replied the captain. "If I'd overhauled
your brig before that pirate fell a-foul of you,
why, then, it would have been a different thing; but,
shiver my timbers, if I ever make war against a
ship's crew in distress. No, no&mdash;I picked you up at
sea, and I don't consider you at all in the light of
enemies. I will set you adrift again the first chance
I have."</p>

<p>"Not on a raft, I hope, Captain Greene, ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"No, but I shall lay the Raker alongside of the
first craft I see that sports a British flag; and after I
have taken it, why I'll put you and your crew aboard,
and you may make the best of your way back to
England."</p>

<p>"Suppose you should run a-foul of one of our
frigates."</p>

<p>"Never fear that&mdash;the little Raker will take care
of herself. She can outsail any thing that floats, now
that we have sunk that bloody pirate. I do think
that he could sail away from her. I always run up
to a vessel or run off from her, just as my spy-glass
tells me I'd better do. You may depend on seeing
old England again before a great while, Captain
Horton, or I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>"I shant be sorry to come within hail of her white
cliffs again, though I did not expect, two weeks ago,
that I should see them for many a long month."</p>

<p>Julia and Florette were seated in the little cabin
below; the French girl was weeping bitterly. She
had done little else since she had been removed to
the privateer. Julia had in vain endeavored to console
her; and rightly judging that it would be better
to allow her grief to have full vent, she had for
several days done little but to see to all her wants,
and whisper an occasional word of cheerfulness and
encouragement. She determined, however, on this
morning to make another attempt to console the unfortunate
girl.</p>

<p>"My dear Florette," said she, "why do you so
continually mourn; all that has happened cannot now
be remedied."</p>

<p>"I know it, lady."</p>

<p>"Then do not weep, Florette, you shall once more
see your native France; and you will be happy
again."</p>

<p>"O, never, never! I have lost all that could make
me happy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have been unfortunate, Florette, but you
have not been guilty."</p>

<p>"Alas! I have been guilty; it is that which grieves
me now more than aught else. No, I should have
died rather than have suffered myself to become the
pirate's mistress."</p>

<p>"Yet you were compelled, Florette."</p>

<p>"Ah! lady, <i>you</i> would not have been compelled;
you would have sooner died&mdash;would you not?"</p>

<p>The flashing eye of Julia, and the warm flush that
covered her cheek and neck, answered the poor girl.
She would not trust herself to answer in words.</p>

<p>"I see you would, dear lady&mdash;and so should I
have done. No, I am guilty. I could have saved
my honor in the arms of death; the pirate's dirk lay
on the table in my cabin&mdash;that would have saved me;
the deep, deep sea was all around me&mdash;there, too, I
might have found an honorable safety."</p>

<p>"My dear Florette, do not think of these things
now. You are sorry for the past, whether you have
done a great wrong, or a small, it is certainly not
one which the good God cannot forgive."</p>

<p>"But the world will not; and, lady, I loved the
pirate-captain; harsh as he was to all else, to me he
was kind&mdash;and now he is dead. O! William,
William!"</p>

<p>"Do not weep for him, Florette."</p>

<p>"I will try not to any more; but, lady, I shall
never be happy again. I shall never again see the
hills of sunny France. I feel that I shall not&mdash;but I
will weep no more. I never close my eyes but the
form of William appears to me. Last night I saw
him. Oh! 'twas a fearful dream; he seemed to me
to rise from the ocean, close beside this brig, and
standing on the blue water, he spoke to me, as I gazed
from this cabin-window.</p>

<p>"'Come, Florette,' said he, 'come with me to our
home in the deep; beautiful are its coral chambers,
and its floors are strewn with pearls. Soft is the
radiance that lights its gorgeous halls, where the
riches of a thousand wrecks are stored; the dolphins
sport like living rainbows in the watery sky above
it, and the huge leviathans guard its golden portals.
Come, Florette, I wait for you, in our home in the
deep.'"</p>

<p>Julia wept as she heard the plaintive tones of the
poor girl.</p>

<p>"Florette, it was but a vision, do not think of
it."</p>

<p>"Well, lady; yet I shall soon join my William&mdash;so
my heart tells me. You will think of me when I am
gone?"</p>

<p>"Often, very often, Florette; but you will soon
be better."</p>

<p>Florette shook her head mournfully, and Julia, who
saw she would not be comforted, left her to herself,
and ascended to the deck. Lieutenant Morris was
in a moment at her side, and in his conversation she
soon forgot the unfortunate girl, who as soon as Julia
had gone, threw herself upon a couch, and gave way
to her cheerless thoughts; her eyes were closed, but
ever and anon a large tear burst through the closed
lids and rolled down the wasted cheeks, which already
the hectic flush, so fatally significant, had dyed with
its lovely hue.</p>

<p>While the trio of old gentlemen kept up their
smoking and conversation on one side of the companion-way,
Lieutenant Morris and Julia took possession
of the other. The young officer had not dared
as yet to speak of his love to her, but he had not
failed to evince it by every thing but words; and he
felt assured that it was known to her, and not treated
with indifference.</p>

<p>"Julia," said he, as they gazed out upon the beautiful
waters flashing in the clear beams of the morning
sun, "do you know that we must soon part?"</p>

<p>"I do not see how we can, Lieutenant Morris,
unless you are going to take a cruise in the jolly
boat."</p>

<p>"We shall soon, doubtless, fall in with some merchant
vessel from your native country, as we are
directly in their course, and then you and your
father, with all the crew of the Betsy Allen, will be
allowed to go on board of it, and return to England."</p>

<p>"Dear England, shall I so soon see it again."</p>

<p>"And will you have no regret at leaving the
Raker?"</p>

<p>"Why, is it not an enemy's vessel?"</p>

<p>"Not your enemy's."</p>

<p>"No, it is not; you have all been kind to us, and
we shall feel as if we were parting with friends."</p>

<p>"Dear Julia," said the young officer, taking her
hand in his, "you will not forget us? You will not
forget <i>me</i>?" and he ventured to press the little hand
he held in his own. It was not withdrawn. Encouraged
in his advances, the young lieutenant was
emboldened to proceed, and bending his head until
he could gaze into the blushing countenance which
was half averted from him, he made his first declaration
of love, and his heart beat painfully as he
awaited her answer.</p>

<p>"Julia, I love you."</p>

<p>He heard no answer from her lips, but he felt a
pressure from the hand he still held in his own, and
was happy.</p>

<p>"Will you be mine, Julia?"</p>

<p>Julia had no affectation in her character, and she
frankly avowed that she loved the young lieutenant,
but could not give him an answer until she had seen
her father.</p>

<p>"I will be yours or no ones," said she; and releasing
her hand, she glided below into the cabin.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris paced the deck in very pleasant
companionship with his thoughts. He did not believe
that Julia's father would strenuously oppose their
marriage, if he saw that his daughter's happiness was
concerned, though he might very naturally prefer
that she should marry one of her own countrymen.</p>

<p>He was disturbed in his meditations by the cry of
"sail ho!" from the foretop-crosstrees. He ordered
the man at the helm to bear away for the strange
craft. As the two vessels rapidly approached each
other, she was soon hull above the water, and Morris
perceived through his glass, that the stars and stripes
floated at her mast-head. A thrill of pleasure, like
that which one feels at meeting an old friend in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
distant land, shot through his veins. Signal-flags
were shown and answered from each vessel, and the
approaching sail proved to be the Hornet, of the
American navy. Each of the two vessels were laid
in stays as they drew near each other, and a boat
from the privateer was soon alongside the Hornet,
and after a while returned with several of the officers
of the latter, who were desirous to pay their respects
to the lady on board the privateer. They were all
highly accomplished gentlemen, as well as gallant
officers; and in after years, when Julia heard of the
fate of the Hornet and her noble crew, she wept
none the less bitterly that words of courtesy had
passed between her and the officers of the devoted
vessel, on the broad ocean, where such kindly greetings
seldom were met or returned.</p>

<p>From the Hornet Lieutenant Morris heard that a
convoy of merchantmen were not far to windward
of him, protected by an English frigate.</p>

<p>"If you keep a bright eye open," said a gay young
midshipman, as he stepped into the boat which was
to reconvey him to his vessel, "you may cut out
one or two of them, for they sail wide apart, and the
frigate keeps heaving ahead, and laying-to for the
lubberly sailers."</p>

<p>And with a touch of his hat, and a wave of his
hand to the fair Julia, on whom his eye lingered as
if she had reminded him of another as bright and fair
as she, whom he had left behind him, the gallant boy
sprung into the boat, and was soon upon his own
deck, which he left only for the deep bosom of the
ocean, when, not long afterward, the Hornet went
down with all sail standing, and the stars and stripes
at her mast-head, in the midst of a terrible storm,
against which she could not stand. There were eyes
that long looked anxiously for the return of the
loved and lost&mdash;hearts that sighed, and spirits that
sunk with the sickness of hope deferred; but there
was no return for those who slept</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h5>FLORETTE.</h5>

<p>In consequence of the information obtained from
the Hornet, the head of the Raker was turned more
to windward, in order to intercept the convoy of
merchantmen; but, owing to miscalculations of their
bearings, she lost them entirely, and after keeping her
course several days, hauled up again, and bore off
on her former track.</p>

<p>Florette had wasted away like a flower in midsummer.
Each succeeding hour seemed to bear off
upon its wings some portion of her beauty and bloom,
as the winds steal away the fragrance from the rose,
and leave it at length withered and dying. Her mind
seemed also to waste with her body&mdash;her brain was
fevered, and the form of the pirate seemed to be
always before her gaze.</p>

<p>The night had set in calm and beautiful, though
the wind blew strong, and the waves were high, yet
the heavens were cloudless, and the bright stars
glided along the upper deep, like bubbles bathed in
silver light.</p>

<p>Julia sat by the side of Florette, in the cabin,
gazing with anxious melancholy upon her wan yet
beautiful countenance, and striving to direct her
wandering thoughts by her own counsel.</p>

<p>"Florette, you seem happier to-night?"</p>

<p>"O, yes! I am happier&mdash;do you not see how he
smiles upon me; his face is not dark to me. See!
he beckons me to follow him!"</p>

<p>And rising, she began to ascend the steps that led
from the cabin.</p>

<p>"Florette, where are you going?"</p>

<p>"With William."</p>

<p>Julia seized her hand and led her gently back to
her seat.</p>

<p>"Come, you are not well enough to go upon deck&mdash;let
us talk of something else. Do you not long to
see France again?"</p>

<p>"France, la belle France?" murmured the poor girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, your own France."</p>

<p>"I see the home of my childhood; O, is it not
beautiful! How full the vine-tree hangs with the
clustering grape, and the village girls are dancing on
the green. I see myself among them&mdash;and I look
smiling and happy; but, O! there is William! how
dark he looks as he gazes through the vines upon me;
he beckons me away. I will come! I will come!"</p>

<p>Julia wept as she looked sorrowfully upon this
wreck of happiness and beauty.</p>

<p>"My dear Florette, I hope you will yet again
dance with your village girls beneath the bower of
vines you seem to see."</p>

<p>"O, never, never! Did I not tell you I should
never see France again? No, no! I am going to
William, he is impatient. See! he frowns!" and
again she strove to break from Julia, but suffered
herself to be restrained by the gentle violence of her
companion.</p>

<p>"Come, Florette, will you not sleep?"</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence seemed to pass across her
countenance, and her eyes lighted as if with a sudden
resolve. She was too weak to escape from Julia,
and with the cunning which so often characterizes
the fevered mind, she determined to attain by deception,
what she saw could not be done otherwise.</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, I will sleep."</p>

<p>And with a smile upon her lips she closed her
eyes, and wrapping her long scarf about her, fell
back upon the couch.</p>

<p>Julia watched her long. In the dim light of the
cabin-lamp she did not perceive that occasionally
those bright eyes were half opened, and fastened upon
her impatiently.</p>

<p>Satisfied at length that she was asleep, Julia
gently left the cabin, and stole upon the deck, where
Lieutenant Morris anxiously awaited her.</p>

<p>The moment her light form vanished, the invalid
rose from her couch, and, with a triumphant smile,
gazed round the vacant cabin.</p>

<p>"There is no one here now, William, but you and
I. Now I will go with you to your beautiful home
in the sea. Stay a moment, let me arrange my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
toilette. I do not look as well as I did, William, or
this glass deceives me; but it matters not, you look
kindly on me still, and I am happy now&mdash;happier
than I have been for a long time. There, William,
I am ready!" and following the shadow of her imagination,
she glided with a stealthy step to the deck.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris and Julia were slowly pacing
the deck, with their heads bent forward, forgetful of
every thing but themselves; a light step was heard
close behind them, and the low rustling of garments.
They turned to look, but too late; Florette sprung
past them, her foot rested on the gunwale, and with
the cry, "I follow you, William!" the form of the
girl disappeared over the side of the brig.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris sprung forward, and the cry of
"man overboard!" was heard from the look-out;
the sails were immediately thrown a-back, and the
boat lowered&mdash;but the body of Florette was not
found. Her long scarf was picked up, stained with
blood; the worthy tar shuddered as he gazed upon it.</p>

<p>"Jack, I told you that shark was not following us
for nothing; he's been in our wake now these ten
days. I knew somebody on board had got to go to
Davy Jones's locker."</p>

<p>"Poor girl! but heave ahead, Bill, it's no use after
this, you know."</p>

<p>Julia was terribly shocked at the dreadful fate of
Florette, and retiring to the cabin, she wept sadly,
and long, for the poor girl&mdash;this last victim of the
<i>scourge of the ocean</i>, murdered no less by him than
were the hundreds his bloody hand had struck dead
with the sword. Even the rude seamen shed tears
for the lost and ill-fated girl; and a silence like that
of the death-chamber reigned on board the little brig,
as it swept noiselessly over the waters. No class of
people are more proverbially light-hearted and
thoughtless than seamen. The sad event of the
preceding night seemed to have passed from the
memories of all on board the Raker with the morning's
dawn&mdash;from all save Julia. She, indeed, often
thought of the unfortunate Florette, and her eyes
were red, as if from much weeping, long after the
pirate's mistress had been forgotten by all others.</p>

<p>To Lieutenant Morris it was but an event in an
eventful life, and if not wholly forgotten by him, yet
slumbered in his memory with other deeds he had
witnessed, as melancholy and appalling as the death
of the poor girl&mdash;for his thoughts were too entirely
occupied by his love for Julia, and the necessary
duties of his station, to find room for other and sadder
recollections.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams, who had just finished his morning
glass, and with a pipe in his mouth, was reclining
in the stern-sheets, a little melancholy, to be sure,
but apparently wholly occupied in watching the long
curls of smoke, which the wind bore off to leeward,
to mingle with the purer air of ocean, was a little
surprised when the young officer approaching him,
requested a moment's conversation on business of
importance.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Williams, I am anxious to know if you approve
of my attentions to your daughter?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman, who had been blind to the progress
of the attachment between his daughter and
Morris, seemed not to comprehend him, which his
inquiring gaze evinced.</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to accept of me as a son-in-law,
sir?"</p>

<p>The worthy merchant had just drawn in a mouthful
of smoke as this question made the matter clear to
him; the pipe fell from his lips, and no small quantity
of the smoke seemed to have gone down his throat,
as, instead of giving any intelligible answer to the
proposition, he was seized with a violent fit of
coughing.</p>

<p>The anxious lover folded his arms with a half
smile upon his countenance, and waited till his desired
information could be obtained.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed the merchant; "excuse me,
sir. Confound the smoke! I understand you, sir;
but it took me by surprise. Have you said any
thing to Julia about this?"</p>

<p>"She has herself referred me to you, if your answer
is favorable, I shall have no reason to despair."</p>

<p>"Ah! has it gone so far as this?"</p>

<p>"I trust you do not regret it, sir."</p>

<p>"You are not an Englishman, Lieutenant Morris,
I believe."</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;that is one objection."</p>

<p>"You are an enemy of England, are you not?"</p>

<p>"I can't deny it, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, there's two objections&mdash;and I suppose I
might find more; but it seems to me that's enough."</p>

<p>As the old gentleman said this with a very decided
air, he picked up his pipe, and began filling it again.</p>

<p>"I do not think those are strong objections, sir;
if I am not myself an Englishman, my forefathers
were, and of good old English blood; and if I am an
enemy of England, I am neither your enemy nor
your daughter's."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all true, but it don't look natural,
somehow, that my daughter should marry an American."</p>

<p>"Such things have happened, however."</p>

<p>"I suppose likely; but, young man, I am not rich.
What little I had was taken away by the pirate, and
I havn't seen it since."</p>

<p>"I care nothing for that, sir."</p>

<p>"But I do."</p>

<p>"I mean, Mr. Williams, that my love for your
daughter will not be influenced one way or the other
by the riches or poverty of her father."</p>

<p>"You seem to be a whole-souled man, anyway,
Lieutenant Morris; and if you were only an Englishman,
you should have my daughter for that speech,
if for nothing else, you should, by St. George! I
recollect when I was rich, the young men were
round Julia as thick as bees; and when I failed,
Lord! how they scattered!"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I am rich enough for us all; beside
a large amount of prize-money, my family estate is
not small."</p>

<p>This last remark seemed to produce a deeper
effect upon the old gentleman than any thing that
had been said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, boy, I will think of it."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris was wise enough to say no
more at that time; he saw that he had nearly, if not
quite, secured the old gentleman's assent; and leaving
him, he went forward.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams followed his manly form with his
eyes, as he stepped lightly over the deck.</p>

<p>"Pity he's not an Englishman&mdash;confounded pity.
He's a fine-looking fellow&mdash;never saw a better;
rich, too. Well, I'll go and talk with Julia. After
all, it will be pretty much as she says about it, I
suppose."</p>

<p>That same evening Julia told her lover that her
father would not oppose their marriage after the
war had closed, but that he was strongly opposed to
its taking place any sooner."</p>

<p>"But it may last forever, Julia."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope not."</p>

<p>"If it does?"</p>

<p>"Why then I'll make father change his mind, I
think."</p>

<p>Morris laughed, and clasped her to his bosom,
the broad main-sail hid them from observation, and
he impressed upon her lips a kiss, warm as his
devoted love&mdash;not the first kiss of love, for he had
been a poor suitor, indeed, if that had been the first.
He then tried to persuade Julia that she and her
father should remain with the Raker, and go with
him to the States; but he did not expect compliance
with this request, and soon desisted from it, devoting
the remainder of the evening to such converse as
was most delightful to him and Julia, but which,
doubtless, would be uninteresting to all others.</p>

<p>He had been afraid each morning that he
should hear the cry of "Sail insight!" for he had
lost his ambition in his love; and he knew that the
first vessel they captured would be given to the crew
of the Betsy Allen, and that with them Julia and her
father would depart. It was with a feeling, then,
that partook more of sadness than any other emotion,
that he heard the long-expected cry.</p>

<p>The sail in sight proved to be an English merchantman,
which, as she was a lazy sailer, was
speedily overhauled. A gun brought her to. As if
determined, however, not to surrender without a
shot, she replied with as powerful a broadside as
she could command, immediately striking her flag.
The only effect of her fire was to frighten poor John,
who had rashly remained upon deck. That courageous
personage fell upon his face, so suddenly, that his
friend, Dick Halyard ran to him, really supposing he
was hit; there was, however, no other expression
than that of fear in the upturned countenance of John.</p>

<p>"O, lud, Dick! you are safe&mdash;how many are
killed?"</p>

<p>"You are the only one, I believe, John."</p>

<p>"Me? I aint hit, be I?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw, John, get up," said Mr. Williams, approaching
him angrily; "don't you see everybody
is laughing at you?"</p>

<p>John rose slowly, anxiously eyeing the merchantman,
as if ready to dodge the first flash.</p>

<p>"A fortunate escape, Dick."</p>

<p>"Yes, another adventure to tell the girls in Lonnon."</p>

<p>"Don't now, Dick."</p>

<p>The merchantman was richly laden, and the honest
captain, who doubtless had his own interest in her
cargo, actually shed tears as he saw the greater portion
of it removed to the privateer. The crew of
the latter could not but pity his distress, but they
thought, and none could dispute the truth, that an
English cruiser would have hardly been moved by
the sorrow and complaints of one of their own captains,
if he should fall into his hands. It was, moreover,
in accordance with the law and usage of nations
at war, and the English captain felt that he was
kindly dealt with, when informed that he would be
allowed to depart with his vessel, on condition of
conveying a number of his own countrymen to their
native shore. He contented himself, therefore, with
cursing the war, and all who caused it. As the
peaceful mariner, he neither knew why the two nations
were at war, nor could he feel the justice of
any laws which involved him in ruin while quietly
following his avocation, content to let others alone
if the same privilege could be extended to him.</p>

<p>Strong arguments have indeed been urged against
the <i>right</i> of the system of privateering! It is no
part of our task either to defend or to condemn it,
yet it would seem evident that, looking at it as a
means of crippling an enemy more efficacious than
any other that can be devised, thereby hastening a
return to peace, it cannot in its broadest sense be
deemed unjust or cruel. Private individuals must
suffer in every war, and fortune had ordained that
the poor merchantman should be one of them. It
would doubtless have been difficult to have persuaded
him that he was suffering for the good of his country.
He certainly did not look nor feel remarkably like a
patriot, and would have much preferred not to have
been used as a means to accomplish the end of war,
and the restoration of peace between the two great
contending powers.</p>

<p>He received Captain Horton, his crew and passengers,
however, with much affability, and when
his ship had parted from the Raker, after cursing the
Yankees awhile in good old Saxon, his countenance
was restored in great measure to its wonted expression
of good humor.</p>

<p>Julia and Lieutenant Morris had parted sorrowfully,
yet full of hope for the future. A heavy box
was also conveyed to the merchantman by orders of
Lieutenant Morris, who told Mr. Williams it contained
an equivalent for his loss by the pirate. It
did indeed contain a sum in gold, which Mr. Williams
would never have accepted had he had an opportunity
to refuse. It produced on his mind precisely
the effect which, without doubt, the young
lieutenant intended that it should, awakening a feeling
of obligation, which would prevent his opposing
very strenuously the suit of the young American,
which there was some reason to fear might be the
case after he had been separated from him and returned
to his own land.</p>

<p>In a short time the two vessels were out of sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of each other. The merchantman reached England
in safety, and Mr. Williams determined to remain
there, inasmuch as he was heartily sick of adventures
on the ocean; and the sum of money left in
his hands by Lieut. Morris enabled him to form a
good business connection in London. With this
arrangement Julia also was pleased, as she felt sure
that as soon as the war closed her lover would be at
her feet, and that the end of hostilities would be
peace and happiness to them, as well as to the contending
nations.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h5><i>The Arrow and the Raker.</i></h5>

<p>The immense injury done to the English service
by American privateers, no less than the splendid
victories obtained by our regular navy, had at length
awakened in the mind of our adversaries a proper
respect for American prowess. They had learned
that the stars and stripes shone upon a banner that
was seldom conquered, and never disgraced. At
this period of the war their attention was more particularly
directed to the privateers, who seemed to
be covering the sea. Almost every merchantman
that sailed from an English port became a prize to
the daring and active foe. The commerce of England
was severely crippled, and anxious to punish an
enemy who had so seriously injured the service,
several frigates were fitted out to cruise especially
against the American privateers; these were chosen
with particular reference to their speed, and one
which was the admiration of every sailor in the service,
called the Arrow, had spoken the merchantman,
just as it was entering the channel, a few days
after its capture by the Raker. No definite information
as to the present position of the privateer could
be obtained from the merchantman, but having
learned her bearings at the time she was lost sight of,
the Arrow bent her course in the same direction,
confident that if he could once come in sight of her
he would find little difficulty in overhauling her.</p>

<p>It was a black, murky, windy day, with frequent
gusts of rain, and a thick fog circumscribed the
horizon, narrowing the view to a few miles in each
direction. Toward evening the fog rose like a
gathered cloud to westward, leaving that part of the
horizon cloudless, and shedding down a bright light
upon the waters. Had the look-out on the Arrow
been on the alert he might have seen, directly under
this clear sky, the topsails of the American privateer,
but the honest sailor had just spliced the main-brace,
and having deposited a huge quid of tobacco in his
cheek, was lying over the crosstrees, in a state as
completely <i>abandon</i> as a fop upon a couch in his
dressing-room.</p>

<p>All on the Raker, however, were on the broad
look out, they knew they were nearing the shores
of England, and liable at any time to come within
sight of an enemy's cruiser as well as merchantman.</p>

<p>Lieut. Morris had for some time been anxiously
scanning the horizon with his glass, and had caught
sight of the frigate's topsails almost as soon as the
fog lifted. As Captain Greene's wounds still in a
great measure disabled him, the lieutenant still kept
the command of the privateer. Unable to determine
whether he had been seen by the frigate or not, he
at once gave orders to bear off before the wind,
hoping that even if such were the case, his little
brig would prove superior in speed to the frigate.</p>

<p>As his brig wore off, with her white sails glittering
in the flood of light, the worthy look-out on the
Arrow had just raised his head to eject a quantity of
the juice of the weed. His eyes caught sight of the
sails as they rose and fell like the glancing wings of
a bird; rubbing his eyes, he took another careful
look, and then cried "sail in sight." The officer of
the deck, as soon as he had got the bearings from the
sailor, could plainly see her himself, and after swearing
slightly at the look-out for not seeing her sooner,
gave orders that all sail should be set in pursuit. As
the fog rapidly lifted from the ocean, each vessel was
able to determine the character of the other, and
when the sun went down, leaving a cloudless sky,
it was evident that the Arrow had gained on the privateer.
Lieutenant Morris felt that his brig must be
overhauled unless the wind should slacken. The
breeze was now so powerful that, while it bore the
frigate onward at its best speed, it prevented the privateer
from making its usual way. Before a light
breeze, Lieutenant Morris felt quite confident that he
could sail away from any frigate in his majesty's
service. He therefore calmly ordered every rag to
be set that he thought the little brig would bear, and
kept steadily on, trusting the wind would die away
to a light breeze after the middle watch. It did indeed
die away almost to a calm, and when the day
broke, although the Raker had put a considerable
distance between herself and the frigate, yet she lay
in plain sight of her, the sails of both vessels flapping
idly in the still air.</p>

<p>Morris knew that he must prepare for an attack
from the frigate's boats, and consequently every gun
on board was loaded with grape and canister, and
carefully pointed; the captain of each gun receiving
orders to be sure his first fire should not be lost, for
that is always the most effective, and indeed often
wins the battle, as many sea-fights will attest. Every
sail was kept set, as this was a conflict in which it
would be no disgrace for the privateer to run if
favored by the wind.</p>

<p>The frigate had by this time lowered three boats,
which were speedily filled by her brave seamen, and
impelled by vigorous oarsmen toward the privateer.
As it would occupy them nearly two hours to make
the passage between the two vessels, the crew of
the Raker paid no immediate attention to their progress,
but quietly partook of their breakfast, and then
girded themselves with their boarding cutlases, and
made ready to defend to the death the little bark they
all loved so well.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris watched with some anxiety for
the moment to give orders to fire. If he could cripple
and sink two of the boats, he felt confident that he
could beat off all who would then attempt to board,
as that would reduce the number of his foe nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to his own number. The boats had now approached
within half a mile of the privateer, evidently making
vigorous efforts each to take the lead. All was silent
on board the Raker, not the silence of fear, but of
suspense. They looked with a feeling somewhat
akin to pity upon the gallant seamen, many of whom
were hurrying to death. Lieutenant Morris himself
stood by the long gun, holding the match in his hand,
and frequently taking aim over its long breech&mdash;another
moment and the fatal volley would be sped,
but even as he was about to apply the match, his
quick eye saw the sails filling with the breeze, and
with the true magnanimity of a generous heart he
stayed his hand.</p>

<p>The light bark fell off gracefully before the wind,
and in the hearing of the volley of curses, accompanied
by a few musket-shots, from the boats, the
graceful brig shot away from them, leaving them far
in the wake. It was but a cap-full of wind, however,
and again the privateer was motionless upon
the calm waters. Alas for many a brave English
heart! With a loud cheer from their crews the boats
again came sweeping on.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" shouted Morris, "'bout ship or I'll
blow you out of water."</p>

<p>He was answered by a musket-shot, which struck
his right arm lifeless to his side, compelling him to
drop the match. Another moment and the foremost
boat would be inside the range of the gun, but with
a cool courage which belongs only to the truly brave,
Lieutenant Morris picked up the match with his left
hand, and though his wounded arm pained him excessively,
without hurry or confusion he waited the
dreadful instant when the gun would cover the boat&mdash;then
the heavy gun sent forth its smoke and deadly
missiles&mdash;as the dense cloud lifted from around the
brig, he saw how terrible had been its effect; the
foremost boat was cut in pieces, and of its gallant
crew only here and there was one able to struggle
with the waves; most had sunk under the deadly
volley. A few were picked up by the hindmost boat,
the second having pressed on with the valor characteristic
of English seamen; they were met, however,
by a heavy fire from the starboard guns, which
had been depressed so as to cover a particular range,
and the second boat like the first was shattered to
pieces. The third busied itself in picking up the
crew, and then lay on its oars, as if aware of the
folly of attempting to board under such a terrible
fire. It is seldom indeed that a boat attack is successful
against a well armed and expecting vessel,
and the attempt on the part of the Arrow may justly
be considered rash, and doubtless arose from a hope
that fortune would favor the assault, rather than
from a confidence in its success.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris had no desire to shed more
blood, and he therefore, after giving orders to load
the long gun, kept his position by it, with his match
ready, but forbore to hail the boat, well aware that
any thing like a taunt from him would bring the gallant
crew forward even to certain death, and confident
that a few moments reflection would convince
the officer of the boat that, if he should make the
assault, he would more likely be a candidate for immortality
than for promotion.</p>

<p>To such a conclusion did that worthy officer
arrive, and having picked up all his wounded companions,
his boat returned to the Arrow, the slow,
heavy strokes of the oars showing how different
were the feelings of those that held them, from the
excited valor with which they pulled toward the
privateer but a short hour before.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the day the two vessels held
their relative positions, but the heavy clouds gathering
over the western sky portended a storm of wind
during the night, and the crew of the Raker felt no
little anxiety, as they were well aware that the frigate
being much the heaviest, would have every advantage
over them in the chase. But there was but
one way, and that was to run for it, not yielding till
the last moment&mdash;for a sailor never yet sailed under
the stripes and stars, that would not rather see his
flag shot down by an enemy's ball, than strike it with
his own hands.</p>

<p>The wind increased by the hour of sunset to so
strong a blow, that it seemed impossible that the little
privateer should escape the frigate&mdash;and it was not
to be doubted that the two vessels would be alongside
each other before morning; yet the Raker was
saved, and by American hands.</p>

<p>On board the Arrow were several native-born
American seamen, who had been pressed into the
English service, and compelled to serve even against
their own country. Three of these sailors were
among the middle watch on board the frigate. They
had watched the whole conduct of the Raker with
a patriotic pride, and were in no slight degree vexed
and disappointed when they saw that the frigate
must in all probability overtake the little brig.</p>

<p>These three sailors were together in the bow of
the frigate, the rest of the watch being on the look-out,
or pacing up and down between decks.</p>

<p>"I say, Bill," says one, "isn't it too d&mdash;d bad that
the little craft has got to be overhauled after all.
She's given this cursed frigate a good run for it,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes she has; the old man has looked black all
day, and sworn a little I guess; here he's kept all
ready for a fight for the last two days&mdash;arm-chests on
deck&mdash;cutlas-racks at the capstan and for'ard&mdash;decks
sanded down&mdash;and haint got within a long shot yet.
God bless the little brig, and the flag she sails under&mdash;the
stars and stripes forever!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the stars and stripes&mdash;'tis just the handsomest
flag that floats."</p>

<p>"By Heaven, and that's the truth! but avast now,
Bill, can't we do any thing for the little craft
ahead?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;d if I see how, Hal; we can't shorten sail,
for we should be seen; and we can't fire bow-chasers,
for we should be heard&mdash;and those are all the ways
I know on to deaden a vessel's speed."</p>

<p>"Bill, I've got my grapples hold on an idear. I
recollect once, when I was a fishing in Lake Winnepisoge,
in the old Granite State, where we used to
anchor with a heavy stone, made fast to a rope, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sometimes we used to row with the stone hanging
over the side, not hauled up."</p>

<p>"Well, Hal, what's all this long yarn about? If
you call it an idear, it strikes me it's a d&mdash;d simple
one."</p>

<p>"Why the yarn aint much, I think myself; and I
shouldn't tell it on the forecastle in a quiet night,
no how; but it's the principle of the thing, Bill&mdash;that's
what's the idear."</p>

<p>"Well, shove ahead&mdash;they allers told me on shore,
before I came to sea, that I hadn't got no principle&mdash;but
that's no sign you haint."</p>

<p>"Now, boys, if we can only get some dead weight
over the frigate's side, it will lessen her way you
see, and the wind may lull enough before morning
to give the little craft a chance to haul off."</p>

<p>"That's a fact, Hal; blast my eyes but they
spoiled a good lawyer sending you to sea. But what
can we make a hold-back of? And there's them
cursed Britishers abaft, sitting on all the rope on
deck."</p>

<p>"That's a poser!&mdash;no, I have it. Can't we drop
these anchors?&mdash;that would do it."</p>

<p>"They'll make a confounded noise running through
the hawse-holes; but let's try it, it's hard work for
three men. Belay it round that pin, Hal! Better
take two turns, 'cause if any body comes toward us,
one more will hold it tight. I believe we shall do it."</p>

<p>"Do it&mdash;of course we will! aint we working for
our country?"</p>

<p>The whistling of the wind through the shrouds,
and the rushing of the waters over the deck, aided
the seamen much in their noble achievement, and
in a short time both anchors were run out to their
full length. Fortunately for them, the watch was
changed before it became apparent that the frigate
was losing ground, and upon the after investigation
of the matter, no suspicion fell upon their watch,
and the perpetrators of the deed were never detected.</p>

<p>As any seaman knows, so heavy a dead weight on
the bow of a vessel would materially lessen its speed;
and by the morning's sun the privateer's topsails
were but barely visible in the distance.</p>

<p>The commander of the Arrow was furious in his
anger, and threatened to flog the whole of the last
watch, as before they took charge of the deck, the
frigate had neared the privateer so much as to give
assurance of taking her; but, after a rigid examination,
no one was punished, and all the captain could
do was to keep a close eye on all his crew, trusting
to discover the traitors at some future time.</p>

<p>As for the gallant Americans, they had the proud
consciousness that though chained to an enemy's
service, they had been able to serve their own
country, perhaps more effectually than if fighting
under her banner.</p>

<p>The wind slackened, and long before night the
Raker was out of sight. She was not, however, to
be frightened off her cruising ground by a narrow
escape, and did not set sail for the States until she
had a full cargo; and, being favored by fortune,
reached her port in Chesapeake Bay, with wealth
aboard for all hands, followed by three English merchantmen&mdash;the
English ensign at their peaks, with
the stars and stripes streaming over them.</p>

<p>The Raker had nearly prepared for another cruise,
when she was stayed by rumors of peace being declared
between the two nations; the report was soon
confirmed, and the gallant crew of the Raker shook
hands together over the news. They were glad, for
the sake of their country, that the war was over, yet
all had acquired a love for their wild and exciting
life as privateersmen; and there was much that partook
of a mournful nature in their feelings, as they
thought that their number must be divided forever.
Some of the crew entered the regular American Navy,
some entered the merchant service; and a few, having
sufficient wealth to purchase farms, made the attempt
to be happy ashore, but after a short time declared
it a lubberly sort of a life, and returned once more
to "do business upon the waters."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris purchased the Raker, and made
one more cruise in her&mdash;not for war, nor for gold, but
for his lady-love. She who had risen like a Naiad
from the wave to be his bride. A year had passed
since he had seen her, and though he doubted not her
truth, it was with an anxious heart that he drew near
the shores of England. He feared lest some hand
might yet dash the cup of happiness from his lips&mdash;perhaps
the unseen hand of death.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams's name was once more good on
'change; and his fair daughter had once more seen
crowds of suitors thronging their doors, among them
were the titled and the proud, who gladly laid at her
feet their titles and their pride&mdash;but still her heart
beat true to the young sailor, though her father now
and then ventured to hint that she had better accept
the hand of Lord Augustus this, or Sir George
Frederick that, remarking that likely enough her
lover had got killed before the close of the war; and
that if she did not be careful, she might never get a
husband of any kind. At these remarks, half expostulatory
and half petulant, from her worthy father,
Julia would smile very quietly, telling him she was
sure her young sailor was alive, and would soon be
at her feet.</p>

<p>She was right in her prescience. The gallant
sailor before another week had passed, after her
father's expostulations, had cast anchor in the Thames&mdash;and
without difficulty found the residence of Mr.
Williams. Julia presented him to her visiters with
pride, for, in the fashionable dress of the day, his
appearance was more brilliant and graceful than any
one of her titled suitors. These soon discovered
how matters stood between the young American and
the fair Julia. Some were wise enough to retreat
from the field with good grace; but vigorous attempts
were made to drive the lieutenant from the course
by two or three others, who could illy bear their disappointment;
but the firm and haughty bearing of
Morris had its due effect upon them, and one by one
they dropped away, until the old merchant, who had
not at first received the lieutenant with much satisfaction,
acknowledged to his daughter that she had
better marry him if she wanted any body, as he was
the only one left. To this Julia assented readily, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
their hands were joined as their hearts had long been;
and the blessing of the old merchant pronounced upon
them, as he saw the happiness which beamed from
his daughter's eyes, as she gazed up from the altar
that had heard her willing vows.</p>

<p>Long years have since then joined the irrevocable
past. Mr. Williams lived several years, to witness
the happiness of his child, but could never be persuaded
to visit America. He had no doubt, he said,
but that it was a very fine country, and he would go
and see it, if it wasn't for crossing the sea, and that
he wouldn't do for nobody. After he had been
gathered to the dead, his children resided entirely on
the family estate of the Morris's, in New Jersey,
where, at this day, they still reside, surrounded by
children with the lofty port of their father, and the
flashing eye of their mother. The tale of the pirate's
death, and the fate of poor Florette, is a tale that
never wearies their fire-side circle, and there, tears
are still shed for the dark scourge of the ocean, and
his devoted mistress; and very often is an old and
gray-headed man, in whom the reader would hardly
recognize our old friend, John, asked to recount
his perilous achievements on the pirate's deck, and
his wonderful escape, obtained by his own right
arm.</p>

<span class="i0">Hearts will sigh. The burdens of distress<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bright eyes grow dim, each rosy cheek grows pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For change is earth's inevitable dower.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And well it is that we may lay aside<br /></span>

<h4>BY THE AUTHOR OF "THE THREE CALLS."</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>Once more the Stanwoods sat of a morning in their
pleasant parlor. Once more the sun streamed lazily
and warmly through the heavy silk curtains, and
once more sat the cherished and beloved invalid in
the cosiest nook, with her spectacles beside her, and
the book on the little table before her.</p>

<p>Something of change might be felt rather than seen
in the blooming faces near her. A thoughtful shadow
on the clear brows of youth, the impression of mind
and feeling that ever shows itself in the deeps of the
eye and about the mouth, where smiles alone no
longer play, but the experience of life is showing
itself in slight but unmistakeable and uneffaceable
lines.</p>

<p>The bell rung, and presently a portly, calm-looking
old gentleman came in, and after chatting a few
minutes on ordinary topics took his leave. It was a
Mr. Gardner of Connecticut; somewhere about the
south part, Louisa thought, and Alice thought him a
very dull person, and they were both rather relieved
when he left them.</p>

<p>"Do you like him, grandmother?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly: at least he is not a person I
should like of myself; but he is connected with much
that has interested me, and he is himself a more interesting
man than you would think him."</p>

<p>"Now, grandmother, dear," said the young girls,
with an earnestness that brought a smile to Mrs.
Stanwood's face, "now do give us one of your <i>real</i>
stories: they are better, after all, than the latest and
newest novel, for they are true ones."</p>

<p>"This Mr. Gardner's story is rather an eventful
one, certainly; he is a phlegmatic sort of man, as you
see, and yet he has not lived without having the
depths of his being stirred. I happened to know him
and about his affairs a good deal at one time, and
afterward I continued my interest in him, though I
saw nothing of him for years&mdash;but it is rather a long
story."</p>

<p>"Never mind the length&mdash;no fear of its seeming
long, because it will be true, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be true, but it is liker a fiction than
any of the true stories I have told you: but if you
are patient with an old woman's stories, and are
willing to begin with the beginning, I will try to be
as sketchy as possible."</p>

<p>"That will we be," said Alice; "when did you
know us otherwise?" and both the girls hurried to
take their seats on a low divan before Madam Stanwood's
arm-chair, and to look attentively up in her
kind face.</p>

<p>"Now then, to begin with the beginning, Mary
Dunbar and myself were visiting at a town somewhere
in the western part of Massachusetts. I could
tell you where, but you may as well have some mystery
about it&mdash;well, there we were visiting, and enjoying
all the hospitalities of a small town where
city people were rather rare articles, and prized accordingly.
The beauty of Mary, and her gentle winning
manners, made a great impression on every
body, and a succession of pleasant rides, walks,
pic-nics, little sociables, and every thing which could
bring young people together, kept us quite delighted
with every thing and every body about us; and as
attentions and admiration are apt to have a pleasant
effect on the disposition as well as the countenance,
I, too, came in for a share, and we were quite the
belles of the time. Every body regretted, however,
and that continually, "that <i>Mr. Gardner</i> was not at
home&mdash;oh! if <i>he</i> could see Miss Dunbar! and oh! if
Miss Dunbar could see him!" and at last he did
come from Burlington, where he had been gone a
good while, at last he did see Miss Dunbar, and as
in duty bound admired her very much. He was a
common-looking young man, as he is now an old
one&mdash;only then he had a fair youthful complexion
and light curling hair, that united strangely with a
premature gravity, and methodical way of saying
every thing. He was not a <i>taking</i> person as you
say, Louisa, but he was the nabob of the place. His
father had died young, and the "Gardner place" was
a very small part of the large property which this
young man had inherited. He kept house, and
managed his large domestic establishment with the
greatest propriety and hospitality. All these things
are looked into thoroughly in such a town as K&mdash;&mdash;,
and young Gardner's character was pronounced unexceptionable,
and the match every way most desirable
for any girl for twenty miles round.</p>

<p>"Mary did not seem to fancy him much, and when
at length her brother came for us, and Mr. Gardner
quietly proposed himself to Mr. Dunbar as Mary's
suitor, and he had told him the connection would
give <i>him</i> great pleasure, they neither of them seemed
to think much more was necessary, for absolutely
nothing was said to Mary till we got home. Mr.
Dunbar lived at Cambridge then, near Boston. He
was a widower, and Mary lived with him, and kept
his house in some sort, and played with his little
boy occasionally. You may suppose she was not a
very staid personage, for she was at this time only
seventeen years old, and as I was more than twenty-seven,
I occasionally checked her wildness, while I
could not help laughing at her graceful follies. She
should have been born of a French mother and a
Spanish father, for she was gay and volatile as the
summer insect, and yet she had much depth of feeling,
and was full of romantic tenderness, with sometimes
a haughty expression that seemed altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
foreign to her usual character of face, and looked
only the index of what might be expected of her if
she should ever be exasperated to fight against her
destiny. But so far destiny seemed to wait humbly
on her pleasure; she was beloved by all, and though
left early an orphan, had found in the indulgent tenderness
of her brother and his wife a delightful home.</p>

<p>"A little while after our return, Mr. Dunbar took
an opportunity when business did not press, for he
went daily into Boston and left Mary and me to ourselves
through the day, just to mention the little matter
of Mr. Gardner's proposal to Mary; and to say
he had accepted it so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>"Now, girls, you must not ask me about characters,
I shall tell you the facts, and you must guess at
the characters of persons by them, the <i>whys</i> you can
ascertain as well as I could tell you. When Mr.
Dunbar had told Mary, who received the intelligence
in silence, he dismissed the topic and no further
allusion was made to it.</p>

<p>"I asked Mary soon after if she considered herself
engaged to Mr. Gardner.</p>

<p>"'Certainly not.'</p>

<p>"I asked her if she liked him, and she gave me
the same laconic answer. So I, too, dismissed the
topic. There was a little mystery in Mary's manner
about this time. If she did not like Mr. Gardner
she did like young Randolph, a Southerner, and a
student, who walked with her, and sent her flowers,
and notes, and all sorts of pretty and poetical things
to read&mdash;poems marked for her eye, and the sweetest
and newest music for her piano. Then of a moonlight
night we had serenades without number, and
soft strains sung in a deep, rich voice, so that what
with flowers, music, notes and very expressive
looking and sighing, the prospect was all but shut out
for poor Mr. Gardner, and opening an interminable
vista for Randolph.</p>

<p>"Weeks went on&mdash;oh, I forgot; in the meantime
Mr. Gardner wrote two letters, one to Mr. Dunbar
about Mary, and one to Mary herself, but not much
about her. It was mostly a business letter, written
in a calm, friendly style, and asking her opinion
about some alterations he proposed making in the
house, adding a wing, I think. He seemed to consider
her a person who had a right to be consulted
in his arrangements, and I remember he finished his
letter with 'Yours, &amp;c.' Mary handed the letter to
me with a look of extreme vexation, which at length
subsided into a hearty laugh. I laughed too, but Mr.
Dunbar did not, and looked rather surprised at us.</p>

<p>"In the course of four weeks from the time of our
return, this ardent lover appeared in person. He
drove up to the door in a very handsome carriage,
and with his servant, all looking very stylish. I saw
Mary color extremely, but she sat quite still, and
when Mr. Gardner entered and went toward her
holding out his hand, she remained in her place, and
did not move her hand at all. He shook hands with
the rest of us. Mary made tea, and one or two persons
coming in, Mr. Gardner became rather animated,
and appeared as he was, a very gentlemanly,
intelligent person. At last Mary could bear it no
longer. She ran out of the room and went up to her
chamber. She shared hers with me, and Mr. Gardner's
was adjoining ours. It was rather late, between
ten and eleven o'clock, and presently Mr.
Gardner, who was somewhat fatigued, bade us good-night
and ascended to his own apartment. I then
went to Mary's room: I found her in a state of great
excitement and indignation, and yet though I sympathized
fully with her, there was something so comical
in the business-like way of doing the thing, which
Mr. Gardner had adopted, and his entire unconsciousness
of the sort of person he was to deal with, that I
began to laugh heartily.</p>

<p>"'Hush! hush! for Heaven's sake! he can hear
every word! Oh, my heart!&mdash;do you believe, he
has come up stairs and gone straight to bed, and is
this minute fast asleep! there&mdash;hear him! don't
laugh! he'll wake as sure as you do!'</p>

<p>"But laugh I did, for I could not help it, albeit
Mary's pallid face and earnest eyes checked me in
the midst.</p>

<p>"'Now I am going down stairs this minute to put
a stop to all this at once. I could not have believed
stupidity could have gone so far. I shall see my
brother and have an end put to his journeys here:
good heavens! to think of it.'</p>

<p>"This I could not object to, of course. Indeed,
from the first of this very peculiar 'arrangement' I
had not been consulted by either Mary or her brother,
and I had a dreamy sort of feeling that by and
by we should all wake up and find Mr. Gardner was
only an incubus, instead of the unpleasant reality he
was getting to be.</p>

<p>"I sat still for nearly or quite half an hour, when
Mary returned to her chamber on tiptoe and looking
very pale.</p>

<p>"'Now, what is it?' said I earnestly, for I saw it
was no joke to poor Mary: her very lips were pallid
and trembling, and her hand was pressed to her side
as if to still the convulsive springing of her heart.</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;I have been talking it over to William,' she
said, in a thick, hasty voice; 'I told him I could go
no further with this man&mdash;this no man&mdash;who is willing
to take me, without so much as inquiring if I
have a heart to bestow&mdash;but oh! oh, Susan&mdash;Randolph
has gone!' she sobbed out in a complete passion
of grief, that could not brook further concealment
or restraint.</p>

<p>"'But how do you know this?' I asked, after, as
you may suppose, I had soothed and hushed her as
far as I was able.</p>

<p>"'William told me so himself. I told him I could
not, would not marry Mr. Gardner&mdash;and he would
not believe me&mdash;called me a foolish, nonsensical
child, who didn't know my own mind&mdash;and at last,
when nothing else would have any effect on his
mind, I said&mdash;I said&mdash;ah! Susan, how hard it was
and is to say it! I loved another!'</p>

<p>"'And how then, my poor child?'</p>

<p>"'Then&mdash;he just in his quiet, calm way, that kills
one, you know&mdash;for it seems the death-blow to all
sentiment&mdash;he said, 'Mary, if you mean young Randolph,
whom I have sometimes met here, playing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
lover, all I can say is, he is too discreet to contest
the field, witness this note of farewell which was
sent to my office this afternoon. He desires his very
respectful compliments to you, Mary.' Would you
believe it, Susan? I took that note&mdash;and read every
word of it; yes, and I smiled, too, as I gave it back
to him, as if it were the most indifferent thing in the
world&mdash;though I felt then, as I do now, every line of
it chilling my heart like ice.'</p>

<p>"'Dear Mary,' I said, still very quietly, for she
grew almost wild with excitement, 'how is this?
Why has Randolph gone? have you had any quarrel?'</p>

<p>"'Quarrel! God help you&mdash;no!&mdash;how should that
be? don't I love the very dust he treads on!' she
screamed out violently at last, and went into a hysteric
fit. The sound of her maniacal voice brought
her brother to the door with anxious inquiry, but as
I told him Mary was a little over excited, and quiet
would soon restore her, at my earnest request he retired.
In a short time I was able, with bathing her
head in cold water, and constantly soothing her with
low murmuring tones of endearment, to see her sobbing
herself into a troubled sleep, and as I looked on
her beautiful face, pale as marble, and the black hair
wetted and matted back from her fine brow, I felt
that I saw a double victim to the cruel indifference
of others, and the violent emotions of her own untutored
nature."</p>

<p>Alice and Louisa Stanwood had gazed steadily into
the face of their grandmother, while in the relation
of this true story, it lighted up with remembered
emotion.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor girl!" said they; "but where, then,
was Mr. Gardener all this while? Surely he must
have relented."</p>

<p>"Truth compels me to say, my romantic girls,
that this quiet-loving lover, to all human appearance,
was not in the least disturbed. Indeed, as I listened to
the painful breathings of Mary, every now and then
catching, as if for life, at a breath, and then hushed
into all but dead silence, I was distinctly aware of
certain audible demonstrations of profound composure
on the part of Mr. Gardner. In sooth, he
was not a lover for a romance writer at all; but such
as he was&mdash;and you must remember our agreement
was that I should only relate facts, not account for
them&mdash;such as he was, he rose with the lark and
took his usual walk, to promote his appetite and prolong
his life.</p>

<p>"When he returned, as Mary was too unwell to go
down stairs, I descended to the breakfast-room where
I found Mr. Dunbar uneasily walking the room.</p>

<p>"'How is Mary?' said he, the moment he saw me?
'No better? Tell her to be comforted&mdash;be quiet.
God forbid I should do any thing to make her unhappy.
I will speak to Mr. Gardner about the
matter myself, and tell him it can't be.'</p>

<p>"His earnest manner quite convinced me that however
he might seem, his sister was really very near
his heart, and 'albeit unused to the melting mood,' I
felt my eyes fill with tears, as I turned and ran up to
Mary's room to comfort her poor heart. She was
comforted and quieted, though she declined leaving
her room till after Mr. Gardner's departure; and I
left her, at her own request, to silent reflection.</p>

<p>"And now you will think all the trouble was over.
But did ever faint heart win fair ladie? Never. And
Mr. Gardner's heart did not sink when he was told
the true story of Mary's indifference and aversion.
Both brother and lover had deceived themselves, or
rather they had not thought about it. But now that
he did think about it, Mr. Gardner was not inclined
to relinquish the pursuit. He knew that women
were fickle and strange beings, and oft-times refused
the very happiness they were dying to possess.
Whether Mary were of this species he knew not, but
at all events the prize was worth trying for. So
he told Mr. Dunbar he would not trouble Mary
more at present, but leave it to time. Time did a
great many things. Time might make him acceptable
to the very heart that now tossed him as a
scorned thing away.</p>

<p>"Now Alice, my dear child, don't give up my
Mary, nor think her a heartless being, when I tell
you that in six months from that time she became
Mrs. Gardner. A very lovely bride she was, too&mdash;pale
as a snow-drop, and graceful as the lake-lily.
She smiled, too, with a sort of contented smile, not
radiant, not heartfelt, not joyous; there were no
deeps of her being stirred as she stood calm and passionless
by the altar, and promised to love and honor
Mr. Gardner, but a very quiet and pensive sort of
pleasure. A part of her soul seemed to have been
buried with the past, and to have been forcibly crushed
down with all its young ardor and bloom forever;
but above it was an everyday being, full of determination
to do her duty, to make her husband happy,
and be as happy herself as she could. So she was
married; and so she stepped into a handsome carriage
with Mr. Gardner, and the bridemaids and groomsmen
followed in another; and never was there a
gayer and merrier cavalcade than at Mary Dunbar's
marriage.</p>
<br />

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>"Now, my dear girls, you must skip over a few
years, during which I neither saw nor heard of Mary
Dunbar. I returned from a journey which I had been
taking, and was glad to feel that Mr. Gardner's house
lay in my nearest route home. I longed to see Mary
in her new character, now that she had had time to
feel and perform her duties, and proposed to be with
her for a few days, that I might form my own opinion
touching this 'mariage de convenance.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Gardner's house was one of some pretension
originally; that is to say, it had been built in the style
of country gentlemen in New England forty years
ago. A row of white-pine pillars surrounded the
house from roof to basement, and formed a piazza-walk
very convenient in a dull day. Six chimneys
crowned the roof, and the whole arrangement was
tasteful and imposing. There was a terrace of green
turf all round the house, and the offices and out-buildings
were at a short distance from the main
building. As the stage-coach wound up the avenue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
I noticed in the disposition of the grounds and shrubbery
the evident hand of female taste. Fantastic
arbors, almost hid behind clematis and honeysuckle;
little white arches supporting twining roses of twenty
sorts, and trees arranged in picturesque groups, gave
a character of beautiful wildness to the scenery.</p>

<p>"I fancied Mary the presiding genius of the place
as I last had seen her, white and bright, with a little
rose-tint on her cheek, caught from nature and the
happy quiet of her life&mdash;for I had heard that she rejoiced
in an infant, whose beauty and promise I
knew must renew all the affectionate sympathies of
her woman's heart.</p>

<p>"The stage-coach stopped. A servant opened the
door, and to my inquiry for Mrs. Gardner, answered
hesitatingly, that 'he believed she did not wish to
see company.' How much of apprehension was
compressed into that brief moment. What could
have happened to her? Much might have happened,
and I not know it, for I had been living in great
seclusion, and had had no correspondence with
Mary. However, I gave my card to the man, and
bade him take it to Mrs. Gardner, meanwhile sitting
with a throbbing heart in the carriage.</p>

<p>"The man returned in a short time with a message
requesting me to stop, and to have my trunks taken
off. Not a welcoming voice or face met me&mdash;and
in silence I followed the servant to the parlor. Mary
was sitting there; some fire was in the grate, though
it was in July; and she hovered over it as if she
sought to warm her heart enough to show proper
feeling at the sight of an old friend.</p>

<p>"'Mary Dunbar!' I cried out, with my arms outspread,
for the figure before me of hopelessness and
gloom gave me a feeling almost heart-breaking.</p>

<p>"The sound of her own maiden name acted like
magic on Mary. She sprung to my arms like a
frightened bird, and clung to me with such intensity
of sad earnestness in her face, that it brought back to
me all the old sorrow of that night of suffering at
her brother's. Once more I soothed her, smoothed
back the dark plumage of her hair, and with soft
words and gentle caresses, brought her to quietness.</p>

<p>"'You are ill, my poor Mary,' I said, as I looked
at her sunken cheek, and the deep gloom about her
eyes. 'Where is Mr. Gardner?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, he is gone most of the time,' said she hastily,
and then, for the first time, seeming to recollect her
duty as hostess, she added, 'but you are tired and
travel-soiled, and hungry, too, I dare say; let me
make you comfortable.' She laughed a little as she
spoke, but not like her old laugh, it was affected, and
died in its birth.</p>

<p>"She rang the bell, gave orders for lunch to be
brought in, and a room prepared for me, with something
of her old activity, and saying cordially, 'Now
you must stay with me; now I have got you here, I
cannot spare you again.' She relapsed into thoughtfulness
and absence. This strange manner puzzled
me not a little.</p>

<p>"I went up stairs. The white dreariness of my
room chilled me. Mary did not accompany me as
she would once have done, to see that all was comfortable
for me. The muslin window-curtains hid
the view outside, and the stately high-post bedstead,
with its gilded tester, looked as if sleep would be
afraid to 'come anear' it. My trunks were brought
up, and then a silence like death was in the house.
No child was in the house, that was clear&mdash;and nobody
else it would seem. Well, I must wait. I
should know all in good time. I dressed and went
down to the parlor. Mary still hovered over the
fire, looking, in her white wrapper and whiter face,
more like a ghost than any living thing. I had intended
to be calmly cheerful, to talk to Mary about
old times, and by degrees to lead her to speak of so
much of her present life as would give me an insight
into the mysterious sorrow that reigned like a presence
over the dwelling.</p>

<p>"But as poor Ophelia says, 'we know what we
are, but not what we shall be.' So no more did I
know how to look at that crouching figure and be
cheerful and calm. I lost all presence of mind, and
could only sit down and cry heartily. Mary rose at
the sound of my weeping and came to me.</p>

<p>"'Do you know I cannot weep, Susan? These
fountains are drained dry. See, there are no tears in
my eyes, though God knows my heart is drowned all
day and night. It is dreadful to have such a burning
head as mine, and no tears to wet it withal.'</p>

<p>"I wiped my eyes and grew calmer when I saw the
wild brightness of her eye; and dreading another
nervous attack, I did my best to quiet both her and
myself. The day passed on without further reference
to any present griefs; she showed me her little conservatory,
with a few rare flowers in it, which she
had reared with much care, and led me over the
pleasantest paths in the grounds and groves attached
to the house. In one of these groves, at some distance
from the house itself, was a little cleared space,
and in the centre of that a small, a very small mound.</p>

<p>"I knew at once what it was. There slept the child
I had heard of. So had been broken the dearest tie
Mary had felt binding her to life. She stood with
me a moment, looking at the mound with a steadfast
look, and then putting back her hair from her forehead,
as if she tried to remember something, she
smiled sadly, and said in a broken voice,</p>

<p>"'You see I cannot shed one tear, even on my
child's grave.' I led her gently away among the old
trees and quiet paths, and we sat in the warm July
shadows till the sun went down.</p>

<p>"You may guess how thankful I was to see at last,
as we turned homeward, the tears slowly falling over
her face and dropping on her dress, as she walked
on, evidently unconscious of the blessed relief. 'Like
music on my heart' sunk these tears, for I knew that
with them would come the coolness, 'like a welcoming'
over her burning pulse, and I carefully abstained
from saying a word that would interrupt the
feelings rather than thoughts which now agitated her.
We returned to the house; tea was served silently,
for even the domestics hardly spoke above a
whisper; and then we sat in the soft moonlight and
looked on the sleeping scene before us. The summer
sounds of rural life had long died away, and nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
but the untiring chirp of the tree-toad was to be heard.
The melancholy monotony of the scene hushed
Mary's spirit to a quiet she had not for a long time
known, and at last she became conscious of having
wept freely.</p>

<p>"'I have wept, thank God! that shows I am human.
Now ask me all about what you want to
know. I think I can talk about it. Mr. Gardner?
Oh, he is gone&mdash;he is gone a great deal, you know;
his business leads him continually away from home,
and that leaves me, of course, very dull&mdash;very.
Shouldn't you think it ought to, Susan dear?'</p>

<p>"Thus incoherently she began; but the first step
taken, and secure of sympathy in her hearer, she
went on, and you will believe me when I tell
you we talked till midnight, and that then Mary
sunk, like a weary child, into my arms in a sound
sleep.</p>

<p>"I cannot give you her precise words, but the import
of her relation I shall never forget. A few words
will suffice to tell you what it took her hours of emotion
and tears to reveal.</p>

<p>"You remember I told you she looked determined
to do her duty, and be as happy a wife as she could.
Did ever a wife succeed in being happy with duty
for the material? Perhaps if Mr. Gardner had been
an ardent lover, somewhat impulsive, and eager to
commend himself to her grateful affection, he would
have succeeded in doing so; indeed, I am sure of it,
in time it must have been so; but, alas! Mr. Gardner
was a calm, gentlemanly, sensible, phlegmatic person,
who thought his wife's impulsive and hasty nature
should be occasionally checked, and who had no
toleration for, nor sympathy with, her excitable
spirit. Consequently, she soon learned to have a
calm exterior when he was at home, which his frequent
absences made it easy to assume. They had
been married something like three years, and Mary
was the delighted mother of a healthy and lovely
daughter. Her heart, which had almost closed in the
chilly atmosphere of her husband's manners, expanded
and flowered luxuriantly in the warmth of
maternity. In her happiness she reflected a part of
its exuberance on her husband, and smiled with much
of her old gayety. 'I felt my young days coming
back to me,' she said.</p>

<p>"One day the post brought a letter for her, which
she opened, and then left the room to read. The
letter was from young Randolph. The writer apologized
for his year's silence to her, by an account of
a long illness, &amp;c. He knew of her happiness, of her
child; in short, he seemed to be informed of every
thing about her. He asked to be permitted to correspond
with her. The letter expressed the strongest and
deepest interest, but couched in such respectful and
friendly terms as were difficult to resist. Mary struggled
long with her sense of what was due to herself
and her husband; but right at last conquered, and she
re-entered the room with the letter in her hand. Tremblingly
she gave it to her husband, who read a part
of it, and then said, with much kindness of manner,</p>

<p>"'Correspond with any of your friends, male or
female, my dear. I have not the slightest objection.'</p>

<p>"Mary's good spirit was still at her ear, and she
said with some difficulty,</p>

<p>"'Mr. Gardner, the writer of this letter was once
much interested in me.'</p>

<p>"'And you in him, eh? Well, my love, those
things are all gone by; I can fully trust you. So
again, I say, correspond with any body you like,
provided you don't ask me to read the letters.'</p>

<p>The generous confidence of her husband deeply
affected Mary; but, unhappily, it did not induce her
to the safe course of declining the correspondence
with this fascinating and dangerous friend. The correspondence
went on for years, nay, it was continued
up to the time of my visit. And now, my dears, I
must stop the current of my story for a minute, to
utter my protest against this most dangerous and
wretched of all theories&mdash;<i>Platonic friendships between
a married woman and her male friends.</i>
But for the false notions of safety in such a friendship,
Mary Dunbar might now be a loved and loving
woman. This you will not believe could have been
with Mr. Gardner; but remember, Mary was getting
to love Mr. Gardner a good deal, and habit and duty
and maternal happiness would have done much; so
that <i>in a sort</i>, she would have been both loved and
loving. The letters from Randolph, which she
showed me, were very interesting, and full of fine
sensible remarks on education, all so interspersed
with gentle and deep interest for herself, that you
saw she was never out of his mind and heart for an
instant. Just such letters as a happy married woman
would never read, and what any woman's instinct
protects her from if she listens to it.</p>

<p>"Things had gone on in this way for two years,
or thereabouts, when the child, who had been the
subject of so many theories, and in whom were garnered
all the <i>conscious</i> hopes of Mary, was taken
suddenly ill. Her anxiety induced her immediately
to summon medical assistance; and she could hardly
believe her physician when he said there were no
grounds for apprehension. The child had a sore
throat; there was a considerable degree of inflammation
about the system, and when he left, he directed
Mary to have some leeches applied to the neck of
the little girl, at the same time pointing to the spot
where he wished them to take the blood.</p>

<p>Mary was particular to place them there, but to
her great alarm, the blood issued from the punctures
in such a quantity as to drench the bed-linen almost
immediately. In vain she tried to stop it&mdash;it flowed
in torrents, and before the horror-struck servants
could summon the physician, the life had ebbed from
the child&mdash;nothing but a blood-stained form remained.
The physician said the jugular vein had been pierced,
and that it was something like half an inch nearer
the ear than he ever saw it before. I believe he was
not to blame&mdash;far less was the wretched instrument,
whose agony I will not attempt to describe.</p>

<p>"But from that hour the nervous spasms and depression
of spirits supervened, which I found had
become the habit of her mind. I should have premised
that through all the distressing circumstances
of the child's death Mr. Gardner was absent. Un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>doubtedly,
could he have been at home, his fortitude
and calmness would have been of the greatest service
to her; but he did not return until long after her maternal
agonies had sunk into a sort of stupor of
wretchedness, which looked like a resigned grief
outwardly. Far enough was her spirit from the
enforced composure of her manner. By degrees she
came to look upon herself as born only to make
others unhappy. That she had caused the death of
her own child was too horrible a thought to dwell on
voluntarily, yet it obtruded itself always&mdash;and she
shuddered at the grave of the being dearest to her heart.</p>

<p>"I remained with Mary until her husband's return,
and then left her, promising to visit her again in the
course of a few weeks. I was pleased to see the
manly kindness of Mr. Gardner's manner to his wife.
He evidently did not understand her, but he was
gentle and quiet in his words to her, and so far as was
in his nature to do, sympathized with her. He was frequently
called away from home for weeks together,
and had no idea of the effect solitude was having on
the mind of his wife.</p>

<p>"As soon as I could so arrange my affairs at home
as to leave them, I went to my sick-souled friend.
I found her in her chamber and lying on her bed.
She looked paler than ever, and her eyes were dry
and tearless as when I first saw her before. All over
the bed, and pressed in her hands, were letters strewn,
half open, and which she had evidently been reading.
She looked up at me when I entered, but immediately
began gathering up the letters with a strange carefulness,
placing them one above the other according to
their dates, taking no further notice of me. I saw
something agitating had occurred, and seated myself
without speaking till she should be more composed.
I knew they were Randolph's letters; I had seen
them before.</p>

<p>"Presently she spoke in a low voice and seemingly
exhausted manner.</p>

<p>"'Susan!' I was by her instantly. She gave me
a folded manuscript. 'Between you and me there is
no need of words. Take this and read it. It is the
last death I shall cause. Leave me now, dear Susan;
perhaps I may sleep, who knows'</p>

<p>"She put her hands over her eyes&mdash;they were
burning as coals&mdash;and tried to smile, but the lips refused
the mockery. I begged her to lie down and
try to sleep, closed the curtains, and left the room,
not a little anxious to see the contents of the manuscript
which I hoped would explain this new grief.</p>

<p>"The first letter was from a clergyman at the
South, containing the intelligence of Randolph's
death, after a long illness, and transmitting, at his
request, the sealed packet to Mrs. Gardner.</p>

<p>"And saddening enough was the recital of the
young man's sorrows. He began with saying that
he had scrupulously abstained from ever mentioning
his attachment to Mary while he had lived, but he
could not refrain from asking her pity for him when
he could never more disturb or injure her. He inclosed
to her his journal, kept from the first day he
saw her, when he loved her with all the fervor of
his southern nature, and all the confidence of youth.
Then followed the shock of hearing from Mr. Dunbar's
own lips of his sister's engagement and approaching
marriage. Then the farewell note of
wounded affection that assumed indifference. Then
a long delirious fever; then the news of Mary's
marriage; and then the vain attempt to conquer his
ill-fated love. His delight in his correspondence
with her; it had been the life of his life, all that
soothed the downward passage to the grave. To that
grave he had gladly come, feeling that happiness was
forever denied him, and only begged her to believe
in his never-varying love from the moment he met
her to this dying hour, when he signed his name to
the last words he should address to mortal.</p>

<p>"All that she had lost&mdash;all she might have been,
and might have enjoyed in a union with this young
man, so brilliant, so amiable, so devoted, rushed on
my heart, and contrasting with the reality a few
paces off, made me weep bitterly. Oh! had they
never loved so kindly!</p>

<p>"I sat long with the manuscript, looking at the
writing, some of it years old, and written with a firm,
flowing hand, then varying through all the vicissitudes
of health and feeling, till it trembled and died
away in its last farewell. The peculiar tenderness
with which we look on the handwriting of the dead,
however personally unknown, affected me. This
young man I had seen, though seldom; and I easily
connected the memoir before me with the memory
of his dark, curling hair, his olive complexion, and
the graceful dignity of his manner. I saw his bright
eye dim, the dew of suffering on his brow, his cheek
pale with anguish of heart and body, and the last
flicker of his glorious light going out in darkness.</p>

<p>"From these thoughts I was roused by a sudden
and deep groan; it seemed near me, and I sprung to
my feet. Bells rang; there was a rush on the staircaise&mdash;a
shriek&mdash;another rush&mdash;the opening of doors
wildly; all this was in a moment&mdash;in the moment I
ran out of my room toward Mary's where an undefined
and terrible fear taught me to look.</p>

<p>"You will guess what met my appalled gaze. Mr.
Gardner, who had returned from a journey while I
was reading in my own room, hastened up stairs to
see Mary. At the moment he entered, she had completed
the act which terminated her life. He received
in his arms the lifeless body. The suffering
soul still hovered unconsciously. We believe that
God who made us, alone can try us, and He who
knew all the wo that 'wrought like madness in her
brain,' can both pity and forgive."</p>

<p>A deep silence followed Madame Stanwood's relation.
Alice and Louise were thinking how little
such an experience could have been guessed from
Mr. Gardner's exterior.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Louisa at last, "if he ever knew
he cause of Mary's death&mdash;did you give him the
manuscript, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what <i>should</i> I have done?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I would have given it to him! I would have
rejoiced to see him one hour feeling all the agony
which poor Mary had felt so long!"</p>

<p>"That is very natural, my child, for you to say;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and, I confess, when I saw him first&mdash;his clothes
covered with his wife's life-blood, and her marble
face on his shoulder; when I saw <i>his</i> calmness, his
complete self-possession, the directions he gave for
the physician, all the time keeping his hand so pressed
on the wound, that no more blood should flow; when
I saw him hold her till the surgeon closed the wound,
and then place his hand on the heart, and watch its
beating, if happily life might yet linger there; when
I saw this, I longed to say, 'thou cold-hearted being!
she is beyond the chill of thine icy love&mdash;care not
for her! the grave is softer and warmer than
thou art!'</p>

<p>"But life had gone out. Not, however, till the
loss of blood had so relieved the agonizing pressure
on the brain, that reason had evidently returned&mdash;for
she opened her eyes, with a sweet, sad smile,
looked at us all&mdash;saw every thing&mdash;knew every thing
that had passed. She raised her hand to her neck,
and then pointed upward, and breathing more and
more softly, like the dead child who had gone before
her, in its baptism of blood, she slept in peace.</p>

<p>"I thought of all that had passed in the hearts of the
two young persons for whom life had so early closed.
They had suffered much, but I did not see how any
good could occur to the dead or the living by further
communication. If Mary had desired it, there had
been opportunity enough. She might have left the
letters for her husband to read. On the contrary,
she had burned them immediately after I had left the
room. Her woman had brought her a lamp, and she
saw her setting fire to letters&mdash;and, in fact, the relics
of them were still in the chimney.</p>

<p>"I therefore said no more to Mr. Gardner. He
had been much shocked with the events of the day,
and for some time was depressed. But he recovered
the tone of his mind, and to this day, I suppose, has
very little comprehension of what was about him
and around him for years&mdash;of the broken-heart that
was so long breaking."</p>

<h2><a name="A_SCENE_ON_THE_SUSQUEHANNA" id="A_SCENE_ON_THE_SUSQUEHANNA"></a>A SCENE ON THE SUSQUEHANNA.</h2>

<h3>HARRISBURG.</h3>

<hr class="short" />
<h4>BY JOSEPH R. CHANDLER.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The incidents of life around us&mdash;of common life&mdash;of
everyday events, and the common scenes which
Nature has prepared on every side, are full of interest,
full of means of gratifying a taste formed or
cultivated to rational enjoyment. The Hymmalayen
mountains may overtop the Andes, and the Amazon
bear more water to the sea than the Susquehanna,
but it follows not thence that the combination of
scenery&mdash;points of beauty to be associated with the
eye&mdash;are less attractive in the latter than in the former;
and though thousands may tread, may ride, or
may murder on the unfrequented path of the elder
world, and give tragic effect to narrative, yet on all
sides of us, in our home experience, and our limited
wandering, events are every day occurring of as
much interest to the participators as are those which
constitute the theme of the foreign tourist; and scenes
are presenting themselves almost daily within our
own observation, that need only the pen of a Radcliffe
to describe, or the pencil of a Claude to depict,
to fix them on the imperishable canvas of the artist
or the immortal page of the gifted poet.</p>

<p>How often have we been struck with the clustering
beauties of a seashore by Birch, or some landscape
by Russell Smith, and while we gazed in
admiration at the production so rich in artistic
skill, and felt astonishment at the fidelity of the
representation, have shrunk away from the picture,
ashamed that objects so constantly before our
eyes should have remained unadmired till the pencil
of the artist had transferred them to canvas&mdash;had selected
the moment when sunshine had brought out
the clustering beauties of some gentle promontory,
or shade had deepened the darkness of the dell, and
all which to our eyes had been daily spread out in
constantly changing hues, had been fixed in beauty
to challenge our admiration and create new love for
the original.</p>

<p>Events which strike us with astonishment in their
record, whether they are real or imaginary, acquire
much of their importance from our knowledge of the
antecedent circumstances and present condition of
the actors. We connect the present with the past,
and our sympathies becoming enlisted with the joys
or sorrows of others, all that relates to them acquires
the exaggerated importance to us which it has with
those who are really connected with the occurrences.
Every group of immigrants we meet, every wedding
party we attend, every funeral train we join, contains
in itself a story of deep and thrilling interest; the
power of genius only is necessary to collect and
combine the incidents, to bring in the feelings and
hopes of the parties, and to present to the reader
what the unobtrusive actor does, feels, hopes, fears
and suffers.</p>

<p>Ungifted to catch the beauties of the landscape and
transfer them to canvas, unpracticed in the simplest
movement of the artist's duties, I can only stand and
admire what Providence has spread around with a
profusion of bounty, and as colors deepen or fade,
and beauties augment or diminish, I bow with admiration
at the object, and increased love to Him
whose hand garnished the heavens, and whose goodness
is as manifest "in these his lower works" as
in the constellated glories of the firmament, whose
systems combine to enrich with heatless light worlds
of space&mdash;and the infinite seems exhausted to gem
with starry lustre earth's evening canopy.</p>

<p>Equally unsupplied am I with that genius which
seizes on passing incidents, and moulds them to important
events, building the interesting and the sublime
on the simple and the ordinary. I have not
these gifts, but I have the love for the gifts, the sense
of their existence in others, and a sort of conception
of the time and the place in which they should be
employed; and often, as I pass along, I select groups
and note incidents that with the child of genius would
be seed for a golden harvest. And scenes, too, that
escape the general eye, or only excite the exclamation
"how beautiful," press upon me till I wish that
I had the genius and skill to fix the picture which
Nature has drawn, and show that our own land and
own vicinity are full of those beauties which true
taste admires, which, transferred to canvas, become
in turn the stimulant to taste. Yet the scenes which
I see, and the occurrences which I note, may be of
use to those who know better how to combine and
present the materials; and what I saw and heard,
others may present in an attractive form.</p>

<p>During the close of August and the first of September
last I was, in obedience to an imperative call,
engaged in some business in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
The little borough was crowded with delegates
to two conventions then being held, for the
purpose of nominating candidates by the opposing
parties for the office of Governor of the Commonwealth;
a part of the machinery to which our institutions
give rise, and those who affect to sneer at
these preliminary movements, do not understand the
true theory and practice of republicanism, where
action, to be effective, must begin in the <i>will</i> of the
people, and to be beneficially operative it must continue
in concurrence with that will. Notwithstanding
the presence of two antagonistic parties there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
were peace and much social intercourse between the
delegates of opposite creeds; nor was this marvelous,
the contest had not yet been delivered to the parties;
the rivalry and antagonism were between the members
of the same party, who should be the candidate&mdash;that
settled on each side, then the divided fronts of
the main divisions would unite, and the hostility be
transferred from sections of the same party to the
parties themselves. The general field of contest was
of course not taken there, so that the elements of
political warfare were held in abeyance, and the
thronged streets wore a holyday appearance of pleasure
and hope.</p>

<p>Standing early one morning at the door of the
hotel, before the customary hour of rising, I was
struck with a little procession from the canal toward
the centre of the place. A stern woman led the
company, in which were four men, two of whom,
and the youngest, each carried a child; and in the
rear was a very tall man, bearing also a younger
child, wrapped about with parts of a ragged female
dress. The man by his height and measured tread
drew attention particularly to himself. The appearance
of the whole was that of poor immigrants;
Germans probably; though the stateliness of the
march of its principal man was that of some one
who had a spirit of independence, and felt that whatever
might be his appearance, he was, for a time at
least, above the influence of outward circumstances.
The company passed me, and for some time I lost
sight of them, and indeed nothing but the peculiar
look of the woman and the remarkable tread of the
man would have kept them in my memory. It was
not long, however, before I saw a gathering in front
of a public building, and loving to hear the remarks
of those who speak out unrestrainedly, I joined the
little company. Its centre was the band of immigrants.
It was evident that some movements toward
effective sympathy had been suggested. What they
were or by what suggested I could not tell. The
strangers could speak little or no English, and for a
time their appearance only appealed to the kindly
feelings of the multitude. I had pressed in close to
the strong man, who was still bearing the little child
in the same position in which it rested when he
passed me at the door of the hotel. The same fixed
look of independence was in his face and his position.
There was much of sternness on the face of
the woman, but it was marked by pain, referable
perhaps to her situation, and to the marks of recent
grief. Something was to be done, but what I could
not yet determine. As I pressed nearer to the man
the company crowded closer.</p>

<p>"You need help," said I to the strange man.</p>

<p>He intimated plainly that he could not understand
me.</p>

<p>"You want <i>bread</i>," said I.</p>

<p>"<i>Das brod</i>," exclaimed he, shaking his head.
"<i>Nein&mdash;das grab!</i>"</p>

<p>And he threw the clothes from the face of the child
on his arm, and the pale, quiet features of the little
one were cold in death.</p>

<p>One low, agonizing cry went up from the depth
of the woman's heart. One proud look around was
given by the father, but that look was exchanged for
one of anguish as he turned his eye downward toward
the burthen which his arm sustained.</p>

<p>The company had come up, not to solicit charity,
that they might eat and drink before they should die&mdash;but
that they might obtain a burying-place for the
little one of their flock, whom death had released
from its parents' troubles.</p>

<p>It was a pretty child; the blue eyes were visible
beneath the half divided lids, and the long lashes
hung over them like gentle palls, defending them
from the rudeness of earth's winds. The fine light
hair lay smoothly over the marble forehead, and a
few white teeth shone out from between the lips
that were shrinking away from each other in the
coldness of death.</p>

<p>It was a <i>grave</i> the parents needed.</p>

<p>The contributions were liberal, and a grave was
provided. It would seem that in the wilderness of
unreclaimed lands which lie along the public works
of Pennsylvania, there might be found a resting-place
for an infant stranger, without the eleemosynary
aid which had been sought&mdash;but, alas! who
does not desire when they "bury their dead out of
their sight," that it may be in a place which memory
may cherish.</p>

<p>We cannot comprehend the unconsciousness of
the grave. We hedge it about, we make the last
house as if comforts were to be enjoyed therein, and
we love to place our dead side by side with others,
as if there were fellowship with the mouldering clay.
It is of no use to argue against this&mdash;it is better perhaps
to encourage the feelings, and assist in their
gratification. They refine the mind, they elevate
views, they meliorate passions and keep alive affections.
Let the resting-place of the dead be sanctified
to all, it is the home of the temple of God. It is the
Moriah of the Christian dispensation.</p>

<p>I cannot leave Harrisburg at any season of the year,
but especially in the early part of Autumn, without
seeking the shore of the Susquehanna at sunset. All
day long the river is beautiful, the quiet stream as it
goes shining down to the ocean is full of loveliness,
and all upon it or near it, partakes of its character.
But it is exquisitely rich and attractive near the close
of the day. I went alone to enjoy the scene. And
placing myself upon the bold bank between the town
and the river I looked westward for the sight that
had so often been enjoyed. It was there; no change
comes over such beauties; they are immortal, they
are without mutation. In the bosom of the broad
river&mdash;glowing with the golden beams of the retiring
sun&mdash;sat the islands that break the unity of the stream
and augment its beauties. So rich, so full was the
sunlight upon the river, that these islands seemed to
be floating in the gorgeous light. Some shot out
prominent angles into the water, and presented
salient points to break the uniformity, while others
sat swan-like down, their rounded edge touching the
stream, as if they had been dressed by art to present
the perfection of symmetry; the dark green of the
shrubbery that sprung up in the moisture of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
islands was mingled with the golden hues of the sun,
and here and there the gentle current, by passing
over some obstructing object, broke into a ripple,
that danced like liquid gold in the sunlight.</p>

<p>It was a rich and lovely sight, one to which frequency
of enjoyment can bring no satiety, and he
who sits down to such a scene finds the impressions
of unfriendly association passing away&mdash;the resolutions
of revenge, which unprovoked rudeness excited,
melting into the better determinations of the heart&mdash;and
all of bitterness and animosity which unchastened
pride encourages, are neutralized and lost in the deep
emotions of love which such a view of God's works
and such a sense of man's enjoyment necessarily
promote.</p>

<p>I sat absorbed in the scene until the sun began to
drop below the hills, and the warmth of the coloring
upon the water was yielding to the neutral and colder
tints of evening, but upward along the sides of the
hills the gorgeousness of the sunlight was in its fullness.
Casting my eyes away to the right, I noticed
a gathering on the upland: and on looking closer I
could discover the forms of those who had composed
the morning procession. They had made a grave
for the little one of their flock, and had gathered
around it to do the last offices to the inanimate form.
They all bowed together, as if taking a last look,
and when they raised their heads, I thought I caught
a little of the wild cry of the anguished mother&mdash;but
I must have been deceived, the distance was too
great, but the signs of grief were <i>visible</i>, and I saw
the father sustaining with his arm the afflicted wife,
and the other members of the group cast their eyes
toward their afflicted female companion. The air
was full of dust, the consequence of a long drought,
and as the floating particles reflected the sunbeams,
the funeral gathering seemed for a moment, bathed in
the glorious light of the setting sun, transfigured on
their mount of sorrow&mdash;transfigured from the poor
mendicant wanderers they had appeared in the morning,
to children of light.</p>

<p>That glorious sunset on the islands and waters of
the Susquehanna cannot soon fade from my memory&mdash;nor
shall I easily forget the blaze of glory shed
around the infant's grave. Strange that the richness
of sunlight should spring from the impure particles
by which it is reflected&mdash;but in this world of ours
what but errors and impurities of the human kind
make visible and beautiful the grace of Him in
whose light and heat "we live and move and have
our being?"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>THE GUBBAUN SEARE.</h5>

<p>One of my own dear countrymen, casting his eye
on the above title, may possibly recognize something
in it familiar to him, especially should he ever have
resided on the classic shores of Galway or of Clare,
our own "Far West;" but to others who may
chance to honor our legend with a perusal, some
few words of introduction are necessary to transport
them, "in their mind's eye," from the city of "brotherly
love," to the far distant and far different land
of the O'Malleys, the Macnamaras,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the Blakes.</p>

<p>An Irishman is, in my humble opinion, rather unlike
a prophet, for this reason, he is in one sense only,
to be honored in his own country&mdash;transplant him;
and though he may be unimpaired, perhaps, in
vigor of body; though he may make an excellent
fabricator of rail-roads and canals, yet it has always
appeared to me he loses his native <i>raciness</i>, except
under very peculiar circumstances; he grows <i>different</i>;
in a word, he gradually becomes&mdash;<i>like the
rest of the world</i>!</p>

<p>Is it the absence of the unique fragrancy of his
native turf smoke, which at home he so freely
inhaled, or is it the substitution of beef and pudding
for his former scanty meals of the never-failing root
of plenty? Let us leave these <i>vexat&aelig; questiones</i>
to those whom they may concern, but on one point
let us give our decided opinion. Our readers may
say, "O, now you all are changed! since your
Father Mathew has made five millions of you <i>teetotallers</i>,
your country is not worth the living in!
No more doth the invigorating, all-inspiring, thrice
concentrated juice of the 'barley grain' push you
forward to glorious deeds of heroic daring&mdash;of skull-breaking,
dancing, or of story-telling; so that for all
intents and purposes you have nothing left worth
chronicling&mdash;<i>you are getting like the rest of the
world</i>!" "Aisy a bit," say I, "the fiddle and the
bagpipes have just the same charms to 'put the
capers in our heels' as in whisky's balmiest days;
and as for story-telling, <i>that</i> we can do equally well
over a good cup of fine hot coffee. No, no; while
the same fresh and <i>free</i> breezes shall continue to be
wafted across the Atlantic to us; while we have our
own green fields and wild, lofty mountains to behold,
Irishmen we shall be in all our better qualities; and
though Father Mathew may have been influential
enough in cooling our heads, (we admit,) yet our
<i>hearts</i> are as warm as ever!</p>

<p>Irish cabins, which you all have heard of, would
not be such bad concerns after all, and we should get</p>

<p>on very well indeed, if we were only a <i>leetle</i> better
treated. On all hands it is admitted that we are
pretty nearly able (and take my word for it we are
willing enough) to eat and to drink all that a bounteous
Providence causes to be brought forth from the
most fruitful of soils; in truth, a superficial observer
might even be tempted to utter an exclamation of
surprise on being told that with a territory one thousand
square miles less than that of the state of Maine,
and six thousand less than that of Pennsylvania, ten
millions of human beings should be supported; but
then consider, kind reader, when our beef, and our
butter, and our eggs, and even the little cabbages
from our gardens, must fly on the wings of steam to
pay the rent, and that rent flies away again, you
know, to pay <i>whom</i>; (a slight glance at a certain
map will tell you that;) consider, I say, that we
cannot always be light-hearted, that a little sadness
will sometimes creep over us. Think how our poor
countrymen must sometimes suffer, and let ever our
warmest sympathies be exerted when we hear of
their distresses.</p>

<p>But, "stop!" you say, "these are twists you're
getting into, indeed. What has this to do with
your legend?" Well, then, reader, jump over with
me into a snug cabin, which is not so very unlike
a log-cabin, only built of stone or mud, (excuse
me,) and sit down with me and a collection of
choice spirits, round a blazing turf fire, keeping it
warm, as we say, with the pipe and the "darlin'
tibacky" taking their accustomed rounds. I may as
well introduce Jimmy Carmody to you&mdash;my "Micky
Free"&mdash;Tom Dillon, and a few others. So, now we
are all settled.</p>

<p>"What's this you're all discussing so learnedly,
boys?"</p>

<p>"O, nothing very partic'lar, your honor, only
we're just saying what mighty quare owld ruins
them is&mdash;them round towers. Did your honor never
see any of them? Sure there's one on Scattery
Island, in the Shannon, and one at Kilmacduagh, I
believe, in this county."</p>

<p>"O, yes, Tom, I've seen those you mention, and
a great many more, too; and if any of you have ever
been to Dublin by the canal, I'm sure you must have
seen the one at Clondalkin. There's one, too, you
know, in the county Wicklow, at the lake that
Tommy Moore made the beautiful song about:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'By that lake, whose gloomy shore<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Skylark never warbled o'er.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why, now, yer honor's perfectially right!" said
Jimmy, who just then remembered some incidents
in his former travels to Dublin about his "little spot of
a pratee garden, that was near being sowld at the Four
Courts for <i>non payment</i>. Quite right your honor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
is. Sure I wint down to see where the blessed Saint
Kevin done all his miracles&mdash;where he turned the
loaves into stones, and where he med the owld king's
goose, that he was so fond of, young again, and
all that; but sure your honor knows all about it; but
after a while, the man that was there showed me a
little hole up over the lake in the <i>clift</i> above, and
'look!' says he, 'that's St. Kevin's bed,' says he.
'Why, then, now!' says I, 'up in <i>that</i> little pigeon-hole!'
says I. 'O! and did his blessed reverince go
up <i>there</i> to bed?' says I. 'No! you fool!' says he,
'but to avoid the darlin' young lady,' says he. 'And
it's <i>there</i> he threw her down into the deep, cowld,
dark lake,' says he. 'Would you like to go up and
lie down in his bed?' says he. 'Is it <i>me</i>,' says I, 'to
do it? Why my brain is like a spider's web wid
lookin' at it,' says I. But a young man that was
used to crawling in them unchristian places&mdash;them
mines&mdash;went up; and I thought I could jump through
a key-hole, I felt so, to see him do it; and says I,
when he came down, 'Young man, I pray, when
you settle in life, you may have a handier way of
gettin' into bed than that, particularly if you're&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Here a burst of laughter, which it is not hard to
elicit from such an auditory, interrupted Jimmy,
who is requested to tell "whether he ever heard
who built these round towers, or why they were
built at all?"</p>

<p>"Why," remarks Jimmy, "<i>why</i> they were built,
no one can tell&mdash;they don't look like any thing
Christian; but the man that undoubtedly built some
of them was the Gubbaun Seare."</p>

<p>"Who was he, Jimmy?" asked all.</p>

<p>"Why, then, your honor, myself doesn't know
much about the Gubbaun Seare, only as the owld
people tell us."</p>

<p>"Well, Jimmy, that don't make what the old
people tell us of no account; for with all our new
improvements, (I had been explaining a rail-road to
them the evening before,) we are obliged to retain
nearly all their inventions also; so you may as well
tell us what you know about the Gubbaun Seare,
for you may depend there must be some truth and
value in it."</p>

<p>"Why, then, that's true for your honor," said another;
a sentence, by the bye, which always greets
you when you utter an opinion, correct or incorrect.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Jimmy, "in them owld times,
I believe, when the round towers was building,
there was a mason&mdash;and if there was, he was as fine
a mason as ever lived, or ever will again&mdash;and, indeed,
your honor, you know the round towers would
prove that, if he built them&mdash;for where is the mason-work
that's equal to what's on them? That one at
Glendalough is a fine one, to be sure&mdash;and there's
many finer than that. Well, he lived in a fine cottage,
somewhere in Munster, and I don't know exactly
where.</p>

<p>"He had been married, and had an only son&mdash;and
proud was he of him, you may depend. Well, it
was given up to the Gubbaun, that he was not only
the best mason in all the world, but along with that,
sir, he was the cutest man known, and the greatest
hand at all kinds of plans and contrivances. He
was able for every one, and any one; and nobody
ever had to boast that they had gained the least advantage
over <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Tom, that with all this wisdom of the
father, the son must have been as wise as he was
himself, or may be wiser?"</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, so one would imagine; but it was
far from him to be as <i>good</i> a boy as the father&mdash;and
that the father knew right well, for he was always
trying to make him sensible of the scaming; but the
son was always too honest, and that vext the father.</p>

<p>"However, he said nothing until the son grew up
a dashin' fine young man; and if he wasn't the best
av scamers, he was nearly as good a mason as the
father himself, and was quiet and <i>honest</i>, only a
terrible simpleton, and what the English gentleman
that used to come to see your honor called <i>spooney</i>;
though what a man had to do with a spoon, myself
doesn't see. But the father racked his brains constantly
to find out some way to make him knowin';
and at last he came to be determined in his mind that
nothing would do the son so much good, or put sinse
so well into his head as a fine, clever, smart young
woman av a wife, if he could meet one to his mind;
and, your honor, though I never tried it myself, I
have no doubt an excellent plan it is. Well, sir,
after he once hit on a plan, sorra long he was in
puttin' it into execution. One morning he got up
very early, and called his son into the field. 'Now,
Boofun,' (that was the young man's name,) 'now,
Boofun,' says he, 'run an' catch the sheep beyant
there&mdash;that big white one, with the fine fleece, and
bring her to me quick!' So Boofun did; an' if he
did, the Gubbaun pulled out his big knife, and kill'd
her; an' by the same token the summer was comin'
on, and the fleece was fine, and long, and silky."</p>

<p>"What did he do that for, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, your honor. When the Gubbaun had
her skinned, he embraced his son, (that's <i>hugged</i>
him, boys, d' ye mind,) an' spoke to him as this:</p>

<p>"'Now, Boofun, avick, (my son,) and it's you
<i>was</i> ever the good boy of a son to me, only I never
could make you understand the coorse of the world's
doin's as well as I could wish; but never heed!
you'll improve yet&mdash;so take courage and do as I desire
you; but mind, if you don't, never call the
Gubbaun Seare your father more, the longest day you
have to live! Do you see that skin?' 'I do, father&mdash;I
see it,' says he, innocent as a child. 'Well, Boofun,
you must take to the road now at once, and you must
walk on, and never stop till you get some one that
will buy this skin, and pay you for it, and then give
you your skin back again into the bargain.'</p>

<p>"'O! O! father!' says the other, 'I'm a fool myself,
I know, and yet I'm sure I wouldn't do sich a
simple thing as <i>that</i>,' says he, 'and I think, indeed,
father, you must be a fool <i>yourself</i> to think so,' says
he. 'Howld your tongue, an' be off, you natral!'
says the father; 'what do <i>you</i> know about it! Be off
at wanst; and here, take this! here's cost enough
for the road,' says he, 'and be sure an' remember
what I towld you,' says he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"So poor Boofun, sir, wint off; and sorrowful he
was to lave his father, and his business, and his comfortable
home, and to go away on what he thought
sich a wild-goose chase. It happened that it was
market-day at the next town, an' many a one overtook
him, an' he cryin'.</p>

<p>"'Well, Boofun,' they'd say, for they knew him,
'are you going to sell that fine sheep's skin?' 'I am,'
he'd say; 'but I know <i>you</i> wont buy it, for by the way
I'm selling it, it would be a dear article for you.'
'Why so, man? I'm in want of wool, an' very little
would make me buy the same <i>skin</i>, for it's fine
<i>wool</i>.' 'Yes, but,' Boofun would say, 'you must
pay me for it, and then give it me back if you buy
it!' So he would be always laughed at, an' he was
nearly dying av dishpair.</p>

<p>"However, on he traveled and walked; and many
miles from home he came to a beautiful lake, all
surrounded with trees, very like that lake where
your honor and the captain, and the ladies used to go
and fish, and make peckthers, (pictures,) Inchiquin
lake, sir; an' if he did, there was as darlin' a young
lady as could be seen, an' she standing on the shore
of the lake, and after finishing washin' some of the
finest fleeces of iligant wool. 'O!' said he to himself,
'if I could only get this darlin' to buy <i>my</i> fleece!
But no one will ever do so foolish a thing as that, an'
I shall never sell it, nor get back again!'</p>

<p>"However, Boofun took courage, and wint up to
her. 'God bless your work, alanna! 'tis yourself's
not idle this morning! And what beautiful wool! I've
a fleece here myself, an' I thought it good, but yours
bates it intirely! I would sell mine, too, but neither
you nor any one else will ever buy it! A voh! voh!'</p>

<p>"'Why, that <i>must</i> be a curious fleece, if no one'll
buy it. Sir,' says she, 'what may be the price?'</p>

<p>"'O, for that,' says he, 'it's for little or nothing
I'd sell it; but what good would that do you, agrah,
when I'm never to enter my father's house again,
nor call myself his son, until I bring him back the
skin and the price of it as well! However, it's no
use talking to you, at any rate, for <i>you'll</i> have nothing
to do with me.'</p>

<p>"'Why, how can you say so till I tell you?'
says she.</p>

<p>"'O, my thousand blessings for that word,' says
he, 'it makes my heart rise like a cork to hear you!'</p>

<p>"'Well, what will you take for the skin?'</p>

<p>"'O, very little, then&mdash;only so much, (mentioning
a small sum.)</p>

<p>"'Very good,' says she, 'I'll give you that much,
and welcome;' and whisper, 'are you the son of the
Gubbaun Seare?'</p>

<p>"'I am; but how could you guess that?'</p>

<p>"'Because,' says she, 'no one could think of such
a plan but his own four bones, <i>and I think I see the
meanin' of it, too</i>,' says she. 'Hand me the skin.'
So Boofun did, sir; and she fell to work, and in a
very short time she had the wool stripped off. 'And
here, now,' says she, 'here is your <i>skin</i> back for
you, and <i>here</i> is the price of it,' says she, handing
him the money; and tell the Gubbaun a very good
<i>buraun</i> the skin'll make,' says she.</p>

<p>"'O, my million thanks to you,' says he; 'though
I never should have thought of this in thousands of
years, yet you've settled it with one word!'</p>

<p>"So, sir, after much more talk, away he ran, and
never stopped till he came home; and the Gubbaun
had just returned from his work, and findin' the house
so lonesome, was almost repentin' he'd ever sent
Boofun away. Glad he was, though, when Boofun
came in, and gave him a great account of all he had
done; but what was his joy when Boofun drew forth
the sheep's skin, and counted out the money. Well,
after some of the joy was over, the Gubbaun put on
a very long, sarious face, 'And now, Boofun,' says
he, 'don't as you love me,' says he, 'deny any thing
I ask,' says he, 'but tell me the truth. I know, you
needn't tell me, it was a woman that thought of the
plan of skinning the fleece, for no <i>man</i> in Ireland
would think of it but myself.'</p>

<p>"'Faix, then, so she said herself,' says Boofun.</p>

<p>"'Hah! well, I knew it was a <i>she</i>; but was she
young or owld? for, by my trowel and hammer!'
says he, 'the owld ones are <i>sometimes</i> as cute
as any!'</p>

<p>"O, then, she was young, and handsome, too, and
rich beside,' says he.</p>

<p>"'O, never mind the riches,' says the Gubbaun,
'for half a grain of sinse is worth a ton of it; but
you're my darlin' son at last, and be off at the first
light of morning,' says he, 'and take the best horse
I have, and put on the best clothes you have, and
bring her home&mdash;and I'll engage she comes.'</p>

<p>"Long before the Gubbaun was up, Boofun started;
and not many hours was he on the road, when he
met the very same young lady, an' she goin' to
market all by herself. Well, sir, they had a great
salutation, an' he coaxed her to take a sate on the
horse. She wanted to get off at the market, but it
wouldn't do, sir; and he came to his father's house
airly in the evening.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd think, sir, the Gubbaun knew it all.
Some said surely that he could foretell. There was
the house, all beautiful and nate, and a most splendid
intertainment on the table; there was a large party of
the Gubbaun's friends, and plenty of all that was
good.</p>

<p>"And the Gubbaun was the boy that <i>could</i> intertain
them all. And, sir, when all were in high good-humor,
and herself laughing and jokin' with Boofun,
then he brought forward <i>the match</i>. To be sure,
she was very shy, and ashamed, the crayther, (all by
herself, you may say,) but you know, sir, even now,
as we see every day, a match isn't long comin'
round, when the parties are willin' an' the <i>spaykers</i>
are good. So it was now; she agreed to lave all for
Boofun&mdash;and she did well. To make my long story
short, in a few days they were married; and in the
meantime they had got <i>her</i> friends' consint. And a
great weddin' they had."</p>

<p>"Well, Tom, now we've got them well married,
jump up for some turf! don't you see the fire's
a'most out?"</p>

<p>"O, then, that your honor may never want for a
good fire, I pray."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Jimmy, nor a <i>good warrant</i>, like yourself,
to tell a good story."</p>

<p>"To be sure, sir, it shortens the night, as we say,
an' if Jimmy wont be offended, for taking the story
out av his mouth, I'll tell your honor some more of
the Gubbaun's doin's."</p>
<br />

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>"That's a good boy, Tom," said Jimmy, myself
doesn't remember any more about him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, sir, they were not very many weeks
married, when the Gubbaun wished to <i>try</i> the wife
still more, to see whether she was knowin' enough
for him, in order that she might be depended on completely,
if any thing should happen. So one day he
towld the son to get ready, and to come with him,
for that he had heard of a fine job of work. So they
started; and when they had got about three miles on
the road, the Gubbaun turned sharp round, and asked
Boofun the distance to the next place.</p>

<p>"'Twenty miles, no less,' says Boofun.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says the Gubbaun, 'every inch of the road
we have to go,' says he, 'but it's too long by ten miles.'</p>

<p>"'Sure I can't help that,' says Boofun.</p>

<p>"'You <i>can</i>, sir!' says the Gubbaun, 'you can
make it <i>ten</i> miles, if you like; and if you can't, go
back, sir, and stay at home with your wife, for you're
not fit to travel with me,' says he.</p>

<p>"Boofun said 'he couldn't do it;' so he had to go
back. And when he came home, his wife ran out.</p>

<p>"'Well, what's brought you back? Any thing the
matter?'</p>

<p>"'Every thing!' says poor Boofun. 'We hadn't
got three miles before the Gubbaun towld me to
shorten the road one half; and sure, you know, <i>all I
could say</i> wouldn't shorten it!'</p>

<p>"'I don't know that,' says she, 'may be not; but
take my advice, run back, and begin to tell him some
story,' says she, 'no matter whether it is true or not,
but amuse him as well as you can; and if he isn't
satisfied, cut my head off when you come back,'
says she. So, sir, he never stopped until he overtook
the Gubbaun; and the very minute he began the
story, he had confidence in Boofun's wife.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, tell us&mdash;what reason could he have
had for that? Couldn't they and she both have taken
care of themselves?"</p>

<p>"Howld on a while, and maybe you'll see, sir."</p>

<p>"They traveled on and on, a hundred miles, or
maybe more, and at last they came to a most splendid,
iligant, noble palace, that the King of Munster was
building. Thousands of masons, and carpenters, and
all kinds of workmen, were in full operation at it&mdash;and
the finest of work they were doing. It was just
dinner-time, as it happened, when the Gubbaun and
Boofun came, but they made no delay, but asked the
steward of the works, sir, for employment, an' they
didn't let an they were <i>any thing in particklar</i>, only
just masons.</p>

<p>"'O!' says the steward, says he, 'there's plenty
av employment for men in your line,' says he, 'but
wait till after dinner, and then I'll talk to you,'
says he.</p>

<p>"'Why, for that matter,' says the Gubbaun, 'it's
a while ago we eat our dinner,' says he, 'and if it's
all the same to you, we'll be glad if you'll set us
some piece of work that we can be at till you come
back.' And just then, sir, the dinner-bell began to
ring. 'Well, gentleman,' says the steward, laughin'
out loud, an' turnin' up his nose, an' winkin' round
to the rest of the men, since you are so impatient, an'
sich wonderful men, just sit down here, and take that
block of marble,' says he, 'and have a cat an' two
tails made out of it when I come back,' says he,
runnin' into dinner.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it was a fine block of stone, sure
enough, and likely, rale Kilkenny marble; but it was
any thing like a Kilkenny cat they med, for they
never stopped until they had a splendid cat, wid two
noble tails carved out, and all this before the lazy
steward and his men came back from their dinner;
and what was the most astonishin' to all, the surprisin'
fierce pair of whiskers that the Gubbaun was
puttin' out from the cat's nose when the steward came
out! But who should be along with him but the King
of Munster himself; and when he saw the cat, and
the two tails, and the warlike pair of whiskers, he
was all but ready to split with the laughin', and when
he got words at last, he never stopped praisin' the
Gubbaun.</p>

<p>"'But,' says the King of Munster, turning round to
the unfortunate steward, (that hadn't one word to
say,) 'you scoundrel! your intention was to make
game of this honest man, and now he has done in one
hour, what you wouldn't do if you were to live as
long as that cat would last; and it's <i>he</i>, and not <i>you</i>,
that has the best right to be steward here,' says he.
So the Gubbaun was appointed steward over all the
palace; and it was he that made all the ornaments,
and all the images and statues that was in the place
intirely, he and Boofun; and the King of Munster
grew fonder and fonder of him every day.</p>

<p>"But, sir, in the course of time the king got curious
notions into his head, and the worst was, that at last
he determined that his palace should not only be the
finest and grandest in all Ireland, but what was
worse for the Gubbaun, he resolved that as soon as all
was finished, he would put an end to the poor fellow's
life, and particularly because he had lately found out
that the King of Leinster had heard of his beautiful
palace, and that he intended to send for the Gubbaun
and construct one still finer.</p>

<p>"But, sir, though the King of Munster was certainly
determined to kill the Gubbaun Seare, he found it
very difficult to lay a plan to do it&mdash;for he well knew
who he had to deal with, and how hard it would be
to catch him. However, the king incraysed his
wages, and made him very well off, so that he
mightn't suspect any thing; but, for fear he should,
he sent for the man who owned the house where the
Gubbaun and Boofun lived, privately, and made him
great presents to keep the saycret, and to lay hands
on the Gubbaun if he suspected that he was about to
start away in any hurry. But, sir, as luck would
have it, this very man's daughter, who loved the
Gubbaun and Boofun dearly, happened to be behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the door, or in a closet, while the king was giving
these horrible directions to her father, and determined
at once to let them know the danger they
were in."</p>

<p>"I wonder, Tom, the Gubbaun didn't suspect
something?"</p>

<p>"O, then, most likely he did, and was well prepared,
I dare say, (for we all know, sir, how hard it
is to trust these kings and great people,) still the girl
found it very hard to make the Gubbaun sensible of
his danger; and she knew there was always a strict
guard over him, and spies out, for fear he'd make his
escape; though, the palace not being finished yet, the
king did not like to do the action for a while.</p>

<p>"One day the Gubbaun and Boofun had been hard
at work at some grand temple, and they came back
at night, mighty hungry. This very girl was the
cook, and she had a very fine lookin' pot of pratees
on the fire for dinner."</p>

<p>"Potatoes, Tom! No! Why they came from
America, a thousand or more years after this!"</p>

<p>"Why, then, now, did they, your honor? Well, I
suppose it was something as good; any how, we'll
call them pratees."</p>

<p>"'Good evenin'!' says the Gubbaun; 'is supper
ready?'</p>

<p>"'O, quite ready,' says she; 'but it's a poor one
we have to-day, only pratees and eggs,' says she;
for you know, your honor, they didn't live <i>then</i> as
we do <i>now</i>&mdash;they knew better than that.</p>

<p>"'Well, them same's good,' says he. 'Did you
never hear the old saying, When all <i>fruits</i> fail,
welkim <i>haws</i>!' for he'd always a pleasant joke or
saying in his mouth. 'But what's this?' says he;
'Why, how came so many raw ones among
them?'</p>

<p>"'O,' says she, looking hard at him, 'if you <i>will</i>
stop <i>here</i>, you must take things as they come, agreeable
and disagreeable, for that's the way they're
going!'</p>

<p>"'By my trowel and hammer!' says the Gubbaun,
to himself, 'if that's the case, its full time to be goin'
ourselves likewise;' and when they were going to
work, he told Boofun every word, for <i>he</i> never suspected.
'But never fear,' says he, 'we'll get out of this
scrape, if they did their worst and their best, and if
they were seventeen times wiser than they are, and
if they had all the guards in his kingdom to watch
me; but howld <i>your</i> tongue, and don't let on a word
of what I've said.'</p>

<p>"Next morning, when the king was up, and in his
room, where he transacted all his affairs, the Gubbaun
came and sint up word that he would be glad to see
his majesty about something that was wanted for the
palace. Now the Gubbaun, sir, was always welcome;
and it was only because the king had <i>too
good</i> an opinion of him, that he was going to kill
him. When he was admitted, 'Well,' says the king,
(mighty grand,) 'is my palace finished, <i>or</i> what do
you want with <i>me</i>?' says he.</p>

<p>"'Why, plaze your majesty's reverence,' says the
Gubbaun, (for he was a fine spoken man,) 'your
majesty's palace is <i>not</i> quite complately turned out
of my hands yet,' says he, 'nor I can't exactly call
it finished, nor let the people that's to come after me
speak of the name of the Gubbaun Seare along with
it, unless one thing is done, that <i>should</i> be done, if
your majesty raylly wishes it to be <i>perfect</i>.'</p>

<p>"'Well, spake your wishes, <i>and then, if I plaze</i>,
they shall be attinded to,' says the king.</p>

<p>"'Well, then, plaze your majesty, there is an
instrument, and without it, your statues, and your
images and pillars can't be polished nor complayted
unless I get it, and that instrument is at home with
me,' says he.</p>

<p>"'What may be the name of it?' says the king.</p>

<p>"'Why, we call it,' said the Gubbaun, (of course
they spoke in Irish,) '<i>Khur enein khur, agus khaoun
enein khaoun!</i>' (and that, your honor, manes, the
tricks upon tricks, and the twists upon twists;) 'no
one in Ireland owns such an instrument but myself,
or at any rate not half such a good one; and if your
majesty plazes, I'll go home and get it.'</p>

<p>"'No,' says the king, '<i>you must never laive me</i>;
when I've this palace built, I'll build another, and
I'll want you; if I let you go now, may be you'd
meet something better, though <i>that</i> you could hardly
do, I believe; but may be you'd die on the road, and
I'd never see you again. <i>No</i>,' says he, 'you must
<i>never</i> laive me!'</p>

<p>"'Do you think so?' says the Gubbaun to himself.
'By my trowel and hammer, though, I think you're
considerably wrong! Why, indeed, your majesty,'
answered the Gubbaun, 'tis yourself that was ever
and always the good friend to me and my son; and,
indeed, so happy am I here, long life and good luck
to your majesty!' says he, 'and may you incrayse,
and long reign,' says he, 'that I would certainly never
wish to part from you, and I'd be satisfied to build
palaces for you all my life; may be, then, in that case,
your majesty would be graciously plazed to allow
my son, Boofun, to set out and get the khur enein
khur, agus khaoun enein khaoun?'</p>

<p>"'<i>No!</i>' says the king, says he, 'I'm nearly as
fond and as proud of Boofun as yourself; and it's my
orders to double his wages, and to double your own
from this minute.'</p>

<p>"'Well, very well, your majesty, let it be so, then.
I would tell no common fellow here where it is, he'd
just break it on the road; and if I'm not, nor Boofun,
to go for this instrument, things must stop as they
are, and the palace will remain unfinished to the end
of the world.'</p>

<p>"The king considered for some time; at last,
'Gubbaun Seare,' says he, 'I <i>must</i> have my palace
finished, and yet I <i>must</i> have your instrument; now
my son, the prince, has nothing on earth to do&mdash;and
will you be satisfied if I send him? I will be your
security that he takes the greatest care of it.'</p>

<p>"'Well, your majesty, your will must be law.
O! O! my poor instrument, if any thing should
happen you!'</p>

<p>"So, sir, the prince was ordered up, and the
Gubbaun gave him all kinds of directions how to
carry it, and towld him where he'd get it, 'in the
big chest, over the chimney-piece.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"The next day the prince set out, and took but one
companion with him; and who should that be but his
younger brother, a young lad that wished for some
divarsion&mdash;and the two only thought it a pleasant ride.</p>

<p>"In a few days they reached the Gubbaun's cottage,
and when Boofun's wife saw them coming, she
was sure something was wrong. Some of her people
were in the house, but she bundled them out; 'Be
ready, though,' says she, 'for fear I'd want you, but
leave those lads to me.' So they came in, and the
prince saluted her most kindly, towld her who he
was, and begged lave to put up his horse. Then she
asked him 'how her husband and the Gubbaun were?'
But he gave her a full account of all I've told you,
as far as he knew. 'But, ma'am,' says the prince,
very gracious intirely, 'there is an instrument that
the Gubbaun can't do without, that he wants to polish
the stones,' says he, 'and my father's so fond of
them both,' says he, 'that he wouldn't let him or
Boofun home,' says he, 'and the Gubbaun wouldn't
let any common fellow come, for fear he'd break it,
and so I'm sent to ask you for it.'</p>

<p>"'And plaze your highness,' says she, 'what may
be the name of this instrument? for he left so many
afther him here, in that terrible big chest over the
chimney-piece, that raylly I don't know which it
could be.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! sure enough,' he said, 'it was in the big
chest,' says the prince, 'and the name of it is&mdash;let me
see, I dare say you know it ma'am&mdash;the khur enein
khur, agus khaoun enein khaoun.'</p>

<p>"'O, yes, your highness!' says she, 'I know the
twists upon twists, and tricks upon tricks very well,
and a very fine, useful kind of instrument it is, as
you'll soon see. I don't know whether I'll be able
to get it out av the chist or not, but if I'm not able,
you can do it aisy, for you're a fine, tall young man,
and may you live long!' says she. So she got up on
a chair and tried, and all she could reach was the lid
av the chest. Then she put another chair on that one,
and tried again, but she could only get her hand a
little way in, and, says she, 'O, the lid's mighty
heavy! but do you try, and I'm sure you'll bring it,
for I can just reach it; I can almost feel it.' So the
prince fell to laughin', and mounted on the chairs in
no time, and opened the big lid av the chest, and
looked in, while she gave the sly wink to one of her
brothers.</p>

<p>"'O!' says the prince, 'but it's very deep! I can't
see the bottom av it yet, it's so dark,' says he; 'get
a candle.'</p>

<p>"'O, no!' says she, 'creep down, your highness;
the instrument is quite at the bottom, I'm sure,' says
she. 'Now,' says she to her brother, 'when I say
<i>you're very near it</i>, catch a howlt av his legs, and
bundle him into the chest.' Now the prince's brother
all this time was ayten some bread and milk, and
never suspected a ha'porth.</p>

<p>"'O, ma'am,' says the prince, 'I <i>can't</i> reach it,'
says he, bendin' over, and balancin' his body on the
edge av the chist, 'is it here at all?' says he.</p>

<p>"'O, you're very near it now!' says she. And,
sir, in a minute they had him doubled up an' pitched
into the chest, and caught a howlt of the young
brother and tied him neck and heels.</p>

<p>"'Ha! ha! what your highness asked for, you got,'
says she. 'In all your life now, did you ever see a
finer trick or a nicer twist? Faix! I think it was a
rale trick upon trick, and a twist upon twist! Your
brother may go back now, as quick as he likes, and
tell his father that as soon as the Gubbaun is done
polishin' the statues, we'll be very glad to see him
back, and Boofun too, and we'll take iligant care of
yourself until he comes; it was a good messenger he
found to go for the khur enein khur, agus khaoun
enein khaoun. That's a fine fellow,' says she, (to
the young chap,) 'pelt away home, and when we see
the Gubbaun and Boofun in view of this house, we'll
release your brother; but mind me! if they are not
in this house within one week from this day, your
father will never see the prince again!'</p>

<p>"So he rode home, tearin' over the roads like
mad, and as soon as he was gone, sir, she had the
prince taken out av the chest, (for he was a'most
smothered,) and took him up the mountains in hide,
and fed him well, and took care av him.</p>

<p>"But O! your honor, how can I tell you how mad
the king was, when he saw the <i>hare</i> that the Gubbaun
had made av him, and how he wouldn't spake a
word all day, but cursin'. However, next mornin'
he considered that after all it was useless to fret, and
that no time must be lost, or he'd lose the prince.</p>

<p>"So he put a good face on the business, and called
the Gubbaun and Boofun to him, but took great care
to explain to the Gubbaun how he didn't mean to
harm him, and all that, and they say that kings and
sich like people were always tolerable good hands
at the <i>blarney</i>. And he paid them all their full amount
of wages, and made them presents, and sent to the
stables, and had two of the most splindid hunters that
could be found saddled and bridled, and gave them to
them.</p>

<p>"Well! they set out, and weren't long till they
got home, and glad and thankful they were for their
great escape; and to be sure Boofun's wife was
proud indeed to see them, and she went and had the
prince brought down, and the Gubbaun invited all
his friends, and a great intertainment was prepared in
honor of his return, and in honor of the prince.</p>

<p>"In the evening, or rather the morning of the next
day, the prince asked leave to take his departure,
but the Gubbaun wouldn't let him go till he had
written a letter to the king, and I think this was the
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<i>May it plaze your majesty</i>&mdash;I returned here
quite safe, but I can't let his highness the prince off
without returnin' you many thousand thanks for all
you have done for me. You have made a family
comfortable and happy for life, and, by my trowel
and hammer, I will forever pray for your majesty's
reverence! However, plaze your majesty, <i>the instrument
I have safe here</i>, which the prince wasn't
able to <i>make out</i>; and in all my expayrience I never
yet met with one that answered my purpose better
than the Khur enein khur, agus khaoun enein
khaoun.</p>

<p>How many beautiful, lovely-minded women do
we meet in society, who are united, by marriage
contract, with men whose tastes, habits and characters,
cannot but be in every way uncongenial. And
on the other hand, how often do we see the finest
specimens of men unequally joined to women who
seem to have no true appreciation of what is really
excellent in morals or social life. The reason for
such inequality is very apparent to all who observe
with any intelligence. The affinities which govern
among those who enter life's dazzling arena, are,
in most cases, external instead of internal. Accomplishment,
personal appearance, and family connections,
are more considered than qualities of the
heart. Beauty, wit, station and wealth, are the
standards of value, while real merit is not thought of
or fondly believed to exist as a natural internal correspondent
of the external attractions so pleasant to
behold. In this false and superficial mode of estimating
character lies the bane of domestic happiness.
Deceived by the merest externals, young persons
come together and enter into the holiest relation of life,
to discover, alas! in a few years, that there exists no
congeniality of taste, no mutual appreciation of what
is excellent and desirable in life, and, worse than all,
no mutual affection, based upon clearly seen qualities
of the mind. Unhappiness always follows this sad discovery,
and were it not for the love of children,
which has come in to save them, hundreds and thousands,
who, in the eyes of the world, appear to live
happily together, would be driven angrily asunder.</p>

<p>Aunt Esther, whose own experience in life, confirmed
by much observation, made the evil here indicated
as clear as noonday to her perceptions, saw
the error of her beautiful niece, Edith, in courting
rather than shunning observation while in society.</p>

<p>"You wrong yourself, dear," she would often say,
"by this over carefulness about external appearance.
You attract those who see but little below the surface,
while the really excellent and truly intelligent
avoid instead of seeking your society."</p>

<p>"Would you have me careless about my appearance,
aunt?" Edith would sometimes say, in reply
to these suggestions.</p>

<p>"By no means," Aunt Esther would reply. "A
just regard to what is appropriate in externals marks
the woman of true taste and right feelings. But you
go beyond this."</p>

<p>"Then I violate the principles of taste in dressing."</p>

<p>"I will not say that you do very broadly. Most
persons would affirm that you display a fine taste,
and in using the word display would express my objection.
I think a woman infringes good taste when
she so arrays herself as to attract attention to her
dress."</p>

<p>"As I do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Edith, as you do. If you disguise from
yourself the fact that you both love and seek admiration
for personal appearance, you do not do so
from others&mdash;at least not from me."</p>

<p>Aunt Esther did not wrong her niece by this judgment.
It was Edith's weakness to love admiration;
and what we love we naturally seek. Without
actually infringing the laws of taste and harmony,
she yet managed to dress in a style that always
attracted the eye, and set off her really fine person
in the most imposing manner. The consequence
was that she had many admirers, some of whom
were elegant and attractive young men. But none
of these were drawn to the side of Edith from a
love of her moral beauty. It was the beauty of her
person, the fascination of her manners, and the
sparkle of her wit, that made her an object of admiration.</p>

<p>Edith had a friend whom she dearly loved; a
sweet, gentle, true-hearted girl, named Mary Graham.
Those who were dazzled by an imposing appearance,
passed Mary with indifference; but the
few who could perceive the violet's odor by the way-side,
as they moved along through life, sought her
company, and found, in the heart of a loving woman,
more of beauty and delight than she ever gives as a
creature of show and admiration.</p>

<p>Different as they were, in many respects, Edith
and Mary were alike in the possession of deep affections.
Both loved what was pure and good; but,
while one had an instinctive power of looking beneath
the glittering surface, the other was easily
deceived by appearances. While one shrunk from
observation, the other courted attentions. The consequence
was, that Edith had hosts of admirers,
while only the discriminating few lingered near the
retiring Mary. The one was admired for what she
appeared to be, the other was loved for what she
was.</p>

<p>Two young men, entirely dissimilar in character,
yet thrown together as friends, by circumstances,
met one evening, when one of them, whose name
was Ashton, said to the other,</p>

<p>"Erskine! I met a glorious creature last night&mdash;a
perfect Hebe!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Edith Maurice."</p>

<p>"She's a showy girl, certainly."</p>
<br /><br />

<br /><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<p>"Showy! She's a magnificent woman, Erskine.
And so you've met her?"</p>

<p>"A few times."</p>

<p>"Were you not enchanted?"</p>

<p>"No. Your glorious creatures never turn my
brain."</p>

<p>"You're an anchorite."</p>

<p>"Far from it. I delight in all things lovely; and,
above all, in the presence of a lovely woman."</p>

<p>"A lovelier woman than Edith Maurice <i>I</i> have
not seen for a twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"Though I have."</p>

<p>"You have, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I think so. She has a friend, named Mary Graham,
whom <i>I</i> think far more interesting."</p>

<p>"Pray introduce me."</p>

<p>"I will, when opportunity offers."</p>

<p>Not long afterward an introduction took place,
and Ashton spent a short time in the company of
Mary Graham.</p>

<p>"That's your lovely woman," said the young
man to his friend, in a tone of contempt, when they
next met.</p>

<p>"To me she is exceedingly interesting," returned
Erskine.</p>

<p>"Interesting! A duller piece of human ware it
has not been my fortune to meet for these dozen
years. I should say she has no soul."</p>

<p>"There you are mistaken. She is all soul."</p>

<p>"All soul! If you want to see a woman all soul,
look at Edith Maurice."</p>

<p>"All body, you mean," replied Erskine, smiling.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" inquired Ashton.</p>

<p>"All external. It is rather the beauty of person
than the beauty of soul that you see in Edith; but,
in Mary, every tone and motion but expresses some
modification of the true beauty that lies within.
Edith bursts upon you like a meteor; but Mary comes
forth as Hesperus, scarcely seen at first, but shining
with a purer and brighter light the more intently you
gaze upon her."</p>

<p>"Not a meteor, my dear fellow," replied Ashton.
"I repudiate that comparison. Edith is another
Sirius, flashing on the eyes with an ever-varying,
yet strong and beautiful light. As for your evening
stars, with their unimpassioned way of shining&mdash;their
steady, planet-like, orderly fashion of sending forth
their rays&mdash;I never had any fancy for them."</p>

<p>"Every one to his taste," said Erskine. "As for
me, I like true beauty&mdash;the beauty of the mind and
heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," returned Ashton, lightly, "let
people go in for hearts who understand such matters.
I don't profess to know much about them. But I
can appreciate, ay, and love a magnificent woman
like Edith Maurice. You can have Mary Graham,
and welcome; <i>I</i> will never cross your path."</p>

<p>From this time Ashton became the undisguised
admirer of Edith. The young man was handsome,
well educated, and had a winning address; yet, for
all this, there was something about him from which
the pure-minded girl at first shrunk. Erskine she
sometimes met; and whenever she happened to be
thrown into his company, she was charmed with his
manners, and interested in his conversation. Unobtrusive
as he was, she admired him more than any
man she had yet seen. But the showy exterior of
Edith hid from the eyes of Erskine her real worth.
He looked upon her as vain, fond of admiration, and
of course, as possessing little heart&mdash;and turned from
her to find a congenial spirit in her friend Mary. Had
Erskine sought to win the favor of Edith, a man like
Ashton would have proved no rival. But Erskine
evinced no disposition to show her any thing more
than ordinary polite attentions, and with an inward
sigh, she suffered the heart which shrunk at first with
instinctive repugnance, to turn with its affections
toward Ashton.</p>

<p>Vain with the thought of having so imposing and
beautiful a woman as Edith for a wife, Ashton did
not stop to inquire whether there was a relative fitness
for mutual happiness, but pressed his suit with
ardor, and won her consent before the half-bewildered
girl had time for reflection. Friends, who
understood the character of the young man, interposed
their influence to save Edith from a connection
that promised little for the future; but their interposition
came too late. She was betrothed, and
neither could nor would listen to a word against the
man with whom she had chosen to cast her lot
in life.</p>

<p>A brilliant and beautiful girl, Edith was led to the
altar by one, who, as a man, was her equal in external
attractions; but he was far from possessing her pure,
true, loving heart. It did not take many months to
lift the veil that had fallen before the eyes of Edith.
Gradually the quality of her husband's mind began
to manifest itself&mdash;and sad, indeed, was her spirit,
at times, when these manifestations were more distinct
than usual.</p>

<p>The experience of a single year was painful in the
extreme. The young wife not only found herself
neglected, but treated with what she felt to be
direct unkindness. She had discovered that her
husband was selfish; and though, to the world, he
showed a polished exterior, she had found him wanting
in the finer feelings she had fondly believed him
to possess. Moreover, he was a mere sensualist,
than which nothing is more revolting to a pure-minded
woman. External attractions had brought
them together, but these had failed to unite them
as one.</p>

<p>No wonder that, in such a marriage, a few years
robbed the cheeks of Edith of their roundness and
bloom, and her eyes of their beautiful light. Those
who met her, no longer remarked upon her loveliness,
but rather spoke of the great change so short
a period had wrought. A certain respect for himself
caused Ashton to assume the appearance of
kindness toward his wife, when any one was present;
but at other times he manifested the utmost
indifference. They had three children, and love for
these held them in a state of mutual toleration and
forbearance.</p>

<p>Ill health was the understood reason for the change
in Edith's manner and appearance. Few, if any,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
knew the real cause. Few imagined that the fountain
of her affections had become sealed, or only
poured forth its waters to sink in an arid soil. In
society she made an effort to be companionable and
cheerful for the sake of others; and at home, with
her children, she strove to be the same. But, oh!
what a weary, hopeless life she led; and but for the
love of her little ones, she would have died.</p>

<p>Mary Graham was united to Mr. Erskine, shortly
after the union of Edith with Mr. Ashton&mdash;and it
was a true marriage. A just appreciation of internal
qualities had drawn them together, and these proved,
as they ever do, permanent bonds.</p>

<p>Mary and Edith had retained a tender regard for
each other, and met frequently. But in all their
intercourse, with true womanly delicacy, Edith
avoided all allusion to her own unhappy state,
although there were times when her heart longed to
unburden itself to one so truly a sympathizing friend.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;it was ten years from the time of
Edith's marriage&mdash;her husband came home in his
usual cold and indifferent way; and while they sat
at the tea-table, something that she said excited
his anger, and he replied in most harsh and cutting
words. This was no unusual thing. But it so happened
that Edith's feelings were less under her control
than usual, and she answered the unkindness
with a gush of tears. This only tended to irritate
her unfeeling husband, who said, in a sneering tone,</p>

<p>"A woman's tears don't lie very deep. But it's
lost time to use them on me. I'll go where I can
meet cheerful faces."</p>

<p>And then rising from the table, he put on his hat
and left the house to spend his evening, as usual, in
more congenial society.</p>

<p>Edith dried her tears as best she could, and going
to her chamber, sought, by an effort of reason, to
calm her agitated feelings. But such an effort for a
woman, under such circumstances, must, as in this
case, ever be fruitless. Calmness of spirit only
comes after a more passionate overflow of grief.
When this had subsided, Edith remembered that she
had promised Mrs. Erskine, who lived only two or
three doors away, to come in and spend the evening.
Had she consulted her feelings now, she would have
remained at home, but as she would be expected,
she rallied her spirits as much as was in her power,
and then went in to join her friend.</p>

<p>How different was the home of Mary to that of
Edith. Mutual love reigned there. The very atmosphere
was redolent of domestic bliss. Mr. Erskine
was away when Edith joined Mary, and they sat and
talked together for an hour before he returned. A
short time before Edith intended going home, he
came in, with his ever cheerful face, and after greeting
her cordially, turned to his wife, and spoke in a
voice so full of tenderness and affection, that Edith
felt her heart flutter and the tears steal unbidden to
her eyes. It was so different from the way her husband
spoke. The contrast caused her to feel more
deeply, if possible, than ever, her own sad, heart-wrung
lot.</p>

<p>Rising suddenly, for she felt that she was losing
the control of her feelings, Edith excused herself, and
hastily retired. Mary saw that something had affected
her friend, and, with a look, made her husband comprehend
the fact also. He remained in the drawing-room,
while Mary passed with Edith into the hall,
where they paused for a moment, looking into each
other's faces. Neither said a word, but Edith laid
her face down upon the bosom of her friend, and
sobbed passionately.</p>

<p>"What is it that pains you, Edith?" Mary asked,
in a low, tender voice, as soon as her friend had
wept herself into calmness.</p>

<p>Edith raised her face, now pale and composed,
and pushing back with her hand a stray ringlet that
had fallen over her cheek, said, with a forced but
sad smile,</p>

<p>"Forgive my weakness, dear&mdash;I could not help
it. A full heart will at times run over. But, good-night&mdash;good-night!"</p>

<p>And Edith hurried away.</p>

<p>A few years more and the history of a hopeless,
weary life was closed. Is the moral of this history
hard to read? No; all may comprehend it.</p>

<h4>BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<div class="blockquot"><p>[It is related of Justin Martyr that, while a young man, walking upon
a certain occasion on the seashore near Alexandria, and meditating
doubtfully on the immortality of the soul, he met a stranger of
venerable appearance, who accosted him, and discovering the subject of
his thoughts, revealed to him the doctrines of the Gospel on that
subject. Justin shortly after embraced Christianity&mdash;became one of the
brightest ornaments of the church&mdash;and suffered martyrdom at Rome, at
a very advanced age. From this text the following sketch was produced,
which may be considered rather as a fanciful outline of what might
have befallen any Christian in the days of Rome's fierce domination,
than as faithfully following the history of any real personage.]</p></div>


<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<p>The sun was setting over the wide waste of sand
which surrounded the ancient city of the great Alexander.
The sultry heat of a summer day was beginning
to give place to a refreshing coolness. All
was calm and still&mdash;the bustle of the mighty city,
faintly heard in the distance, seemed to enhance the
quiet of the solitary shore upon which walked one
alone and in deep thought. He was a man in his
youthful prime, but clad in the grave robes of one
devoted to the study of philosophy, and his face was
marked with the lines of much thought and study.
Sometimes he moved slowly on, his eyes fixed on
the sand which the retiring tide had left a firm and
even footing. Anon he paused to look at the play of
the little waves, as they came murmuring in, and
curled their light foam over the last traces of his footsteps.
Far as the eye could reach, the blue waters
of the Mediterranean spread themselves, scarcely
agitated by the faint breeze, and reflecting, in a long
line of undulating light, the glory of the setting sun.
As the bright luminary sunk, the eye of the wanderer
rested on it, and a shade of deep melancholy gathered
over his face.</p>

<p>"Another day thou hast fulfilled thy task, O sun!
and done thy Makers bidding&mdash;again thou hidest thyself
in the ocean's bosom, to arise to-morrow with
renewed splendor. Thou art no enigma, to give the
lie to all the conclusions of philosophy. Clear as
thy light is the purpose for which thou wast hung on
high; steady as thy Maker's will is thy bright obedience.
<i>Thou</i> fulfillest thy destiny&mdash;but man, man&mdash;I
and such as I&mdash;alas! we but resemble these useless
waves which foam out their little moment and vanish
on the barren sand. Alas! shall it never be that we
shall find a solution of the mystery of our being?
How aimless, how useless, appears our existence.
Confined to this narrow stage, how vain are our
mighty energies, our inexhaustible wishes, our infinite
hopes. Where now," he exclaimed, as turning
to retrace his steps, his eye was caught by the
towers and temples of the distant city, lit by the sun
with transitory splendor, "where now is the mighty
hero who founded yonder city? He is gone forever
from the stage of being, as little regarded or remembered
as the dust which the hurrying crowd tramples
in its streets. O for some certainty, some assurance
that this life is not <i>all</i>; that hereafter permitted to
awake from the sleep of death, man shall yet fill a
part worthy of his mighty spirit, shall yet find in
infinite perfection an object on which to expend
those treasures of thought and feeling which corrode
hidden here in his heart, or are wasted on idols as
vain as yonder vapor which rises from the sea."</p>

<p>Absorbed in mediation, he had not perceived until
now that another was approaching, walking at a slow
pace along the margin of the sea. As the stranger
came nearer, the young philosopher could not avoid
observing him with interest. He was apparently
very aged. Long locks of white hair streamed on
his shoulders and mingled with the hair of a beard
equally as white. His robe was arranged with careful
soberness, and in his hand he carried a staff,
though his erect and firm figure did not seem to need
its support. In his clear, bright eye, his ruddy cheek
and benign expression, appeared intelligence, health
and goodness, all the beauty of a green old age, all
the charm of the fully ripened autumn of life. As
they drew nearer each other, the stranger looked
earnestly on the young philosopher, who regarded
him with increasing interest.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know me, my son," said the old man,
at length, "that thou lookest on me so earnestly?"</p>

<p>The young man bowed reverently as he answered.</p>

<p>"No, father; but I wondered to see one like thee
here at such an hour."</p>

<p>"I am here," replied the stranger, "to meet one
who promised to be with me at this place. But what,
my son, brings thee to this lonely spot, when yonder
busy city is thronged with whatsoever can minister
to pleasure or the thirst of knowledge?"</p>

<p>"It is therefore I am here; for it is when alone
with the great Author of Nature, among his works,
that we can best seek that highest wisdom which is
learned only by meditating on His nature and the end
of our being. The fountains of divine philosophy
may be found even here in the cold sea-sand."</p>

<p>"Alas! my son, and if they be, of what avail shalt
thou find them? The sand upon which the showers
descend vainly for centuries, is not more barren nor
more unstable than that philosophy of which thou
makest thy boast."</p>

<p>"I boast not&mdash;I am but a seeker after Truth."</p>

<p>"Ay, so say all you philosophers; but what profit
shalt thou have of that truth which cannot be practiced
in life, nor console thee at death?"</p>

<p>"My father, it was but now that I lamented to
myself my own useless and aimless existence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the vanity of those speculations wherewith we strive
in vain to pierce the mystery of our being. There
are moments when that foundation of reason on
which I build my hopes of eternal life seems to shift
beneath my feet, as unstable as this sand; when life
and its purposes, death and its consequences, seem
to me a mystery more unfathomable than yonder sea.
What assurance have I that my existence will not
terminate like that of the beasts which perish? What
certainty that, with my mortal frame, this spirit which
I feel within me shall not also die and disappear forever?
It is true, there are many probabilities that
the soul is immortal, nature and reason seem alike to
teach that it is so, but still I have no assurance, still
that mighty hope at times seems vain, often it is
eclipsed entirely, and my soul is shrouded in darkness."</p>

<p>"My son, what wouldst thou give to one who
could give thee an assurance, a positive certainty,
that thy hopes of immortality are not vain?"</p>

<p>"Did there exist one able to give me that assurance
I would deem the devotion of my whole life a poor
return for so vast a blessing. But thou mockest me
with so vain a hope. No created being is able to
give me such assurance, or is worthy of belief did
he promise it. No&mdash;the great Maker of my spirit
alone can reveal to me if it be immortal; but where
shall I seek him to ask for that revelation? He is to
be found only in his own works, and I can but go
back to that school, and strive by meditation on Him
to strengthen my spirit in the only faith which gives
any value to life."</p>

<p>The stranger regarded the young man with a long
and wistful gaze.</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou believe me, my son, were I to tell
thee that I possess that assurance? that I am as firmly
convinced of my existence after death, as I am that
I am now a living, breathing man? that I feel an
absolute certainty that you and I will meet, immortal
spirits, before the throne of God, who is the Judge of
all men?"</p>

<p>The young philosopher smiled mournfully, regarding
the aged man with a look of affectionate pity.</p>

<p>"Thou thinkest now that this is delusion, but it is
a truth, a hope full of immortality. Listen, my son;
has God left himself without a witness of his own
existence? Is it not written on the heavens and on
the earth in characters as clear as the light that he is,
and that his hand hath made all these things? Behold
the sun which performs his daily task so perfectly,
the stars which write all over the heavens
the story of God's glory. Go forth into the field and
behold his work. See him preparing the bright cloud,
which the winds gently upheave, from whose bosom
drops the softening shower&mdash;how richly the grass
springs in the valley&mdash;how the golden grain steals
splendor from the sunbeam which has smiled on it so
long&mdash;how his hand is ever at work providing for
the wants of his creatures, and ever reminding men
by this silent ministry that he is the Author and
Giver of every good and perfect gift. If God hath
so clearly revealed the great truth of his own existence,
is it not reasonable to suppose that he hath in
like manner revealed to man that truth concerning
his own destiny which it is most important for him
to know?"</p>

<p>"That it is, indeed," replied the young philosopher,
"on which we build our hopes. It is reasonable,
and it may be hoped that God will yet make
such a revelation&mdash;but, alas! it is only a hope."</p>

<p>"My son, my son, it is no longer a faint, uncertain
hope, it is a matter of perfect certainty, and if thou
wilt abide by my words thou wilt find it so, and it
shall give thee, after a season, a peace past all understanding.
If thou wilt but submit thyself to God's
teaching thou shalt no longer grope as the blind at
noonday, but a light above the brightness of the
heavens shall shine into thy soul."</p>

<p>The young man bowed his head, and crossed his
arms upon his breast, as he sadly replied, "God's
teaching&mdash;but where, O, my father, may it be found,
save where I have vainly sought&mdash;among his works?"</p>

<p>The old man, without reply, drew a manuscript
from his bosom, and laying his hand on the arm of
the other they walked forward together over the
smooth sand, while he read aloud high and burning
words, which the ear of his companion drank eagerly
in. Upon that silent shore, in the still evening air,
arose that clear voice, uttering to the astonished
sense of the young heathen philosopher the argument
of Paul the Apostle, in which he persuades the Corinthians
of the resurrection of the dead. He read on
and the other listened as one in a dream, and the sun
had gone down over the wide sea and outspread
sands where they walked alone, and one silver star
came forth in the west, the lovely Vesper, and looked
at its image in the quiet wave, as the old man read,
with tears which would not be restrained, the mighty
conclusion, "O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave,
where is thy victory?"</p>
<br />

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p>Behold another scene in the shifting panorama of a
life. In a poor and humble chamber, on a mean
couch, lay one dying. It is evening, and he is alone.
Fearfully sounds the gasping breath and the low moan,
terrible is the look cast upward in anguish. The
hurrying tread of the busy multitude is heard without,
the sound of music and merry voices, and
trampling of steeds and rattling of wheels, and still
he lies there alone. He is aged and poor, and his
kindred have forsaken him, for the heathen creed
taught nothing better than the leaving such as he to
struggle alone with the last enemy. The light of
evening waxes fainter and fainter, and now a step
is heard on the threshold, and a form enters, dimly
seen in the fading twilight. It is the same we beheld
on the seashore hearkening to the words of eternal
life. The seed there sown germinated soon under
the culture of that faithful teacher. In that heart it
found a good soil, and it sprung up, and bore fruits
manifold of faith and temperance and heavenly wisdom.
That divine word taught him to seek his suffering
fellow mortals and minister to their necessities.
This was not his first visit to this poor dying man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and he was welcomed even now with joy and gratitude.
How gently did he smooth the pillow, how
tenderly support the sinking frame, how kindly bathe
the brow and wet the parched lips. Philosophy had
not taught him this. O, no! occupied in high meditation,
she swept past the couch of suffering humanity;
"commercing with the skies," she forgot that man's
mission is to his fellow man, and that his life's business
is to do, not altogether to think. Christ had
taught this young disciple a new, a different and a
better lesson; and he sat there now, patient and
humble beside the dying man, regarding him, not as
an atom, soon to be swept from an aimless existence,
but as an immortal spirit shaking off encumbering
clay and preparing for a new and glorious state of
being. With his own hands the young Christian
lighted the little rude lamp which hung from the
ceiling, and sat down on a low stool by the bed-side,
and drawing a manuscript from the folds of his robe,
read aloud the same hallowed words he had first
heard on the seashore in the still twilight of a summer
evening long past away. Sometimes he paused to
add a word of comment or explanation, and when
he had finished reading, he kneeled down to pray.
He was famed even then in the schools of philosophy.
He had been the envy of his fellow-disciples in the
academic grove for his profound wisdom and various
learning. But had one of those fellow-students stood
there and beheld him, he would have scorned him.
He kneeled on the stone-floor. The dim light of the
lamp fell on his bowed head and long, dark robe, and
lit faintly the couch of the dying beggar. The only
sounds to be heard were the voice of earnest, heartfelt
prayer, and the quick breathing which told that
life was ebbing fast with him for whom that prayer
was offered with trembling accents and tears fast
falling. But, ah! there was a presence there better
than philosophy, greater than Plato, holier than
Socrates, "higher than the kings of the earth," even
of Him "that sitteth on the circle of the heavens,"
and saith "To this man will I look&mdash;even to him that
is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my
word."</p>

<p>The whole night through the young Christian was
a patient watcher by the bed of death. Once he had
wasted the midnight oil in the study of vain wisdom
and false philosophy, utterly forgetful that thousands
lay all about him perishing in ignorance and misery.
Now how rich was his reward when the glazing eye
opened with a gleam of intelligence, and the pale lips
murmured the sweet hope of pardon, or strove to
frame the language of some remembered promise
from the word of God. The noise of the great city
had long ago subsided. Solemn, indeed, was the
stillness; and the spirit of that faithful watcher almost
quailed when the King of Terrors laid hold of his
victim with the last, inexorable grasp. Long did he
struggle in that savage hold with agony not to be described.
At last it was over, and he lay calm and
scarcely breathing. The beams of the cold, pale
dawn stole in and dimmed "the ineffectual fire," of
the lamp, as the young man bent over that form to
ascertain if life yet lingered in it. As he did so the
dying eyes opened. How full of consolation was
that look! He pressed the hand that still held his; a
faint, sweet smile stole over his face, and he whispered
in a tone so low that the eager ear of the
listener could scarcely catch it. "Thanks be unto
God who giveth us the victory through Jesus Christ
our Lord!" They were the last words. As the golden
sun rose once more to light the towers and temples
of the city, he sent one rich beam into that humble
chamber. The Christian was alone with the dead
now. He had composed the body in decent order
with his own hands, and reverently covered it over.
The face was still visible, but no distortion was there;
the lips were gently closed, and the eyes, as if in
slumber; the white locks fell quietly down over the
hollow temples and wasted cheeks, and over all was
written the fulfillment of the promise, "Thou shalt
keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon
Thee." Awful is the presence of Death always; and
when he has set his seal on the aged servant of God,
there is a holiness there which every human spirit
must bow down before. No matter how rude the
form, how coarse the features&mdash;with his plastic hand
he moulds them into lines of superhuman grandeur.
He robs the face of the hues of life, and it becomes
as pure as marble. He touches the white hair, and
it falls into beautiful repose. He breathes on the
distorted brow and smoothes every wrinkle. We
know that the messenger who has wrought this
wondrous change is none other than the servant of
God, that he is the last commissioned of the ministering
spirits to the earthly tabernacle, that he hath no
more that he can do, and he compels us to look on
his handiwork and stand in awe.</p>

<p>Long did the young Christian gaze on the face of
the dead with solemn thoughts and unuttered prayers&mdash;not,
indeed, for the departed spirit, for he knew that
with that his business was accomplished and over
for ever&mdash;but for himself, that his latter end might be
such. His thoughts, not unnaturally, went forward
into the distant future, and speculated on his own
dying hour, and he wondered what might be its accompaniments.
He prayed that it might be as peaceful
as this he had just witnessed, that he might descend
into the grave as a shock of corn fully ripe; that he
might lie down with the sweet consciousness that his
work was done, and his reward sure. With no unhallowed
curiosity did he strive to pierce the future,
but had some evil genius been permitted at that moment
to lift the veil which hid his own death-scene,
how would he have shrunk and shuddered, and his
yet young faith fainted in the contemplation.</p>
<br />

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>It was a bright, busy day in Imperial Rome. Never
had her resplendent sun shone more brightly on her
marble palaces, her gorgeous temples, her lovely
groves and gardens. The scented air stole in through
open windows, where sat secluded lovely damsels
and noble matrons; and it wantoned, too, over humbler
homes, where little children played and sung
and shouted joyously. It fanned the cheek of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
pale student, as he paced the lonely grove in silent
meditation, and lightly touched the troubled brow of
the orator as he took his way to the forum. It wooed
the captive, in his cell, to dream of freedom and long-remembered
home. In the streets were heard quick
footsteps, and loud, merry voices. Traffic went on
in the crowded mart, and pleasure was pursued in
the luxurious halls of the noble. Here, flower-crowned
guests reclined at the banquet, listening to
sweet music, while yonder the squalid miser counted
his gold, and there a fair young mother smiled upon
her children. Just the same passions crowded into
human hearts that day, just the same delusions were
followed, the same pleasures felt, arid the same griefs
deplored on that bright day in Imperial Rome, as now
agitate, or delight, or torture us who have beheld that
great city a living tomb.</p>

<p>While all this went on in the fresh air and sunshine
of a summer-day, far down, beneath the earth which
upheld the city, were other and sadder sights. In
those terrible caverns, which run in veins of darkness
under its foundations, which travelers now fearfully
explore by torch-light, human beings, guilty of no
crime but that of bearing the name of Christians,
were shut up, expecting, hoping no release until
summoned to a frightful death. In a solitary cell,
small, damp and noisome, lighted by a dim lamp, an
aged man sat alone. It is easy to picture to ourselves
the hideous gloom, the walls sweating unwholesome
vapors, the oppressive thickness of the air, never
stirred by a fresh breath from heaven, the jar of water
and mouldy crust, the miserable garments, the pallid
face and emaciated form of a prisoner in such a place.
It is less easy to guess what might be the thoughts of
one sitting there in expectation of an instant summons
to execution. More than seventy years had
laid their weight upon him. His hair was quite
white, but his eye was bright and beaming, his whole
countenance informed with a noble, thoughtful expression,
and beautified, despite of man's cruelty,
with benevolence. It was plainly to be seen that
only the outer tabernacle of the spirit was suffering
and declining, while that within was burning brighter
and higher as the mortal part drew toward extinction.
He knows that his days are numbered, but he meditates
peacefully on the change which awaits him.
He knows that his death will be painful and ignominious,
but he knows not yet the exact manner of
it&mdash;at least, it will be the end of his long course, and
then remain only the reward and rest. He has now
nearly arrived at a long-desired period, and he finds
all the sweetness of that immortal hope which first
dawned upon his soul on the seashore beside far-distant
Alexandria. It seems as if that glorious faith
could only be known in its perfection of consolation
in such a dungeon, and awaiting such a doom; and
promise after promise from the word of God comes
upon his memory, making that living grave "all
glorious within." Yea, it will be a blessed change.
To-day he will be done forever with sin and sorrow,
and to-morrow he will be "where the wicked cease
from troubling." To-day he will take farewell of a
world lying in wickedness, and to-morrow will behold
him a companion of "just men made perfect."
To-day he will quit his dungeon and miserable garments,
and wear to-morrow a crown of glory and
robes of righteousness.</p>

<p>As these promises and hopes crowded upon his
mind, his meditation was disturbed by a long, low,
sullen roar, which seemed to shake the ground he
rested on. He started up with anguish and terror in
his face. He listened. Again it came, distincter
than before, with a sharper, deeper cadence. He
shuddered visibly, and his face grew paler in the dim
light, and large drops of sweat broke out upon his
forehead. The third time it was repeated, and then
all was silent. He listened long, with strained ear
and eye, which seemed to pierce his dungeon walls;
but he heard no more. He sunk back, and covering
his face prayed in an agony. Now, too well he knew
what was to be his doom. He had heard the voice
of his executioner. It was the desert lion roaring
for his prey. Now he remembered that in these
caverns were confined the Christians reserved for
martyrdom, and, in still lower cells, the wild beasts
to which they were to be surrendered in the bloody
amphitheatre. It is no wonder that mortal terror,
for a season, took possession of the soul of the aged
Christian. He shrunk with unutterable horror when
he thought of the savage beast, rendered fiercer by
protracted hunger; of the crowded amphitheatre, the
gazing eyes, the exulting shouts, the unpitying human
hearts. It was long before he could bring himself
to look beyond these and upward to Him
who sat enthroned on high and watched tenderly
the falling sparrow. He was a Christian hero,
but he was also a man. His sensitive human
frame, his natural human will shuddered and revolted
at the execution of this frightful doom, and
it was not until hours had passed, and he had wrestled
mightily in prayer, that he learned to contemplate it
calmly. Then great consolations were vouchsafed
him; his crown glittered bright before him; the passage
to death was shown him as short, though terrible,
the hereafter, long, long and glorious, even glory forever
and ever. Above all he was shown the cross;
and, O, how inexpressibly dear was the Lord who
hung there; and how sweet was that most beautiful
of all the promises, "God himself shall wipe away
all tears."</p>

<p>It needs not to tell how his furious jailors burst in
upon his solitude. How they dragged him to the
arena. How, when the blindness from the intolerable
sunlight had passed, he beheld the crowded
rank on rank of eager spectators, and heard the
shout which greeted a fresh victim. He looked
upward to the clear, blue sky, where soft, lovely
clouds floated here and there, and he inhaled the
sweet, elastic air. There was the usual offer of reprieve,
pardon, life, at the cost of a single act of
idolatry. There was heard at the same instant, the
savage roar of the hungry lion, now kept near in
waiting for his prey. There was the shout of triumph
when that last offer was refused, calmly, contemptuously.
Then he quickly found himself alone in the
vast arena. Other victims had been there before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
him. He saw the blood, hastily and slightly covered&mdash;he
looked round once more; alas! there was no
human eye to pity, and no hand to spare. With a
bound the mighty beast was in the arena, and close
upon him.</p>

<p>It was soon over. This was the conclusion of the
day's spectacle, and plebeian and patrician Romans
were on their way homeward, talking of this and
that, merrily, carelessly; and the so lately crowded
Amphitheatre was solitary and deserted. But the
sun, with his mighty eye, looked down upon the guilty
spot, and his hot beam drank up a portion of the fresh
blood, and the winds of heaven sighed round it, and
the clouds came and cast their shadows over it; and
centuries have passed since then, and still the sun
and winds and clouds have gone about it, day after
day, and still the eye of God beholds, and its dumb
walls and crumbling arches cry aloud for vengeance.</p>

<h2><a name="GAME-BIRDS_OF_AMERICA_NO_X" id="GAME-BIRDS_OF_AMERICA_NO_X"></a>GAME-BIRDS OF AMERICA.&mdash;NO. X.</h2>

<h3>THE RAIL. (<i>Rallus.</i> <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us.</span>)</h3>

<p>Taken altogether, the generic characters of the
several kinds of Rail may be stated to be as follows:
the bill longer than the head, straight or slightly
curved, compressed at the base, and cylindrical toward
the tips, the upper mandible channeled, the
nostrils opening longitudinally at the base of the bill
in the grooves, open through and through, but in
part closed with membrane; legs very stout, bare of
feathers to some distance above the tarsal joints,
with three long toes to the front and one to the rear,
articulated on the tarsus, the front toes free or divided
to their bases; the wings of mean length and
rounded, the first quill being shorter than the second,
and the third and fourth the longest in the wing.</p>

<p>The Clapper Rail, or Mud Hen, is one of the most
remarkable, and like its relative, the Corncrake of
England, makes its note heard all the night long. It
is fourteen inches in length and eighteen in the
stretch of the wings; the bill is two inches and a
quarter long, slightly bent, and of a reddish-brown
color; the upper part is black, and streaked with dull
brown; the chin and streak over the eye are
brownish-white; the fore neck and breast are reddish-brown;
the flanks and vent black, with white tips to
the feathers; the coverts of the wings are dark
chestnut-brown, and the tail-feathers and quills dusky,
without any margins; the legs are dull brown, and
the irides dark red. This species is very common,
during the summer, through all the latitudes of the
United States, keeping near the sea-coast, as it prefers
the salt marshes to the waters of the interior.
It is a very noisy bird, especially during the night
and before rain, which are, of course, the times when
the <i>molusca crustacea</i>, and other small animals, upon
which it feeds in the marshes, are in the greatest activity,
and most easy to be obtained.</p>

<p>Wilson's account of the casualties to which it is
exposed in the breeding season, is so graphic, that we
shall in part quote it. "About the twentieth of May,"
he says, "they usually begin building and laying
at the same time; the first egg being usually dropped
in a slight cavity lined with a little dry grass pressed
for the purpose, which, as the eggs increase to their
usual complement, is gradually added to till it rises
to the height of twelve inches or more, doubtless to
secure it from the rising of the tides. Over this the
long, salt grass is artfully arched, to conceal it from
the view above; but this very circumstance enables
the experienced egg-hunter to distinguish the spot at
the distance of thirty or forty yards, though, imperceptible
to a common eye. The eggs are of a pale
clay color, sprinkled with small spots of dark red,
and measure somewhat more than an inch and a half
in length by an inch in breadth, being rather obtuse
at the small end. These eggs are delicious eating,
far surpassing those of the domestic hen. The height
of laying is about the first of June, when the people
of the neighborhood go to the marshes <i>an egging</i>, as
it is so called. So abundant are the nests of this
species, and so dexterous some persons at finding
them, that one hundred dozen of eggs have been collected
by one man in a day. At this time the crows,
the minx, and the foxes, come in for their share, but,
not content with the eggs, these last often seize and
devour the parents also. The bones, feathers, wings,
&amp;c., of the poor mud hen lie in heaps by the hole of
the minx, by which circumstance, however, he himself
is often detected and destroyed." It seems as if
the very elements were in conspiracy against these
birds; they "are subject to another calamity of a
more extensive kind; after the greater part of the
eggs are laid there sometimes happen violent north-east
tempests that drive a great sea into the bay,
covering the whole marshes; so that at such times
the Rail may be seen in hundreds floating over the
marsh in great distress; many escape to the main
land, and vast numbers perish. On an occasion of
this kind I have seen, at one view, thousands in a
single meadow, walking about exposed and bewildered,
while the dead bodies of the females, who
perished on or near their nests, were strewed along
the shore. The last circumstance shows how strong
the tie of maternal affection is in these birds, for, of
the great number which I picked up and opened, not
one male was to be found among them, all were
females; such as had not yet begun to sit probably
escaped. These disasters do not prevent the survivors
from recommencing the work of laying and
building anew; and instances have occurred in which
their eggs have been twice destroyed by the sea, and
yet in two weeks the nests and eggs seemed as
numerous as ever. If all is well, the young are
soon able to run about, which they do with great
swiftness, and tread the grass and other marsh plants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
with wonderful dexterity. They can swim in smooth
water, though they are, of course, ill able to contend
with an inbreak of the sea. Swimming is a much
more severe action in them, however, than in birds
which have the feet webbed or lobed; though they
strike powerfully, their stroke tells but little upon the
water; and the rapidity of their stroke proves their
distrust of that element&mdash;their feet are for the land,
not for the water, and on the level ground and the
leaves of floating plants, they run with astonishing
rapidity."</p>

<p>The Virginian or Lesser Clapper Rail is scarcely
distinguishable from the true Clapper, except by its
reduced size; and in every part of America it appears
to be a somewhat rare species. It confines itself to the
fresh-water marshes, and thereby escapes many of the
mishaps which befall its relative. This circumstance
also has caused the people of New Jersey to bestow
upon it the name of the Fresh Water Mud Hen, and
renders it not unknown on the bogs and swampy
grounds near the Ohio and Mississippi. Their flesh
is not inferior to that of the Soree, but their diminutive
size renders them little sought after as game.
The Soree or Common Rail of America, than which,
perhaps, none affords a more delicious repast, or
more agreeable amusement, is now before us.</p>
<br />

alt="CAROLINA RAIL" title="" /></div>
<h4>CAROLINA RAIL. (<i>Crex Carolinus.</i> <span class="smcap">Bonaparte.</span>)</h4>
<br />

<p>The natural history of the Rail, or Soree, or Coot,
as it is called in the Carolinas, is involved in much
mystery, the process of incubation being still more
unknown than the exact places where it is effected.
The general character of the Sorees is the same as that
of the two other species of Rail already mentioned.
They run swiftly, fly slowly, and usually with the
legs hanging down, become extremely fat, prefer
running to flying, and are extremely fond of concealment.
In Virginia, along the shores of the James
River, the inhabitants take advantage of the effect
produced upon the Rail by fright much in the following
fashion. A mast is erected in a light canoe,
surmounted by a grate, in which is a quantity of
fire. The person who manages the canoe is provided
with a light paddle, and at night, about an hour
before high tide, proceeds through and among the
reeds. The birds stare with astonishment at the light,
and as they appear, are knocked on the head with
the paddle and thrown into the boat. Three negroes
have been known to kill from twenty to eighty dozen
in the space of three hours. The reeds attain their
full growth along the shores of the Delaware in
August, when the Rail resort to them in great numbers
to feed upon the seeds, of which they, as well
as the Rice Birds, are excessively fond. The eloquent
Wilson, than whom no one could more enjoy
the pleasures of Rail-shooting, thus speaks of the
sport: "As you walk along the bank of the river
at this period, you hear them squeaking in every
direction like young puppies. If a stone be thrown
among the reeds, there is a general outcry and reiterated
kuk, kuk, kuk, something like that of a
Guinea-fowl. Any sudden noise, or the discharge of
a gun, produces the same effect. In the meantime
none are to be seen, unless it be at or near high
water; for, when the tide is low, they universally
secrete themselves among the interstices of the reeds,
and you may walk past, and even over them, where
there are hundreds, without seeing a single individual.
On their first arrival they are generally lean, and
unfit for the table, but as the reeds ripen they rapidly
fatten, and from the twentieth of September to the
middle of October, are excellent, and eagerly sought
after. The usual method of shooting them in this
quarter of the country is as follows: The sportsman
furnishes himself with a light batteau, and a stout,
experienced boatman, with a pole of twelve or
fifteen feet long, thickened at the lower end to prevent
it from sinking too deep into the mud. About
two hours or so before high-water they enter the
reeds, and each takes his post, the sportsman standing
in the bow ready for action, the boatman on the
stern-seat pushing her steadily through the reeds.
The Rail generally spring singly, as the boat advances,
and at a short distance ahead, are instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
shot down, while the boatman, keeping his eye on
the spot where the bird fell, directs the boat forward
and picks it up as the gunner is loading. It is also
the boatman's business to keep a sharp look-out, and
give the word 'Mark!' when a Rail springs on either
side without being observed by the sportsman, and
to note the exact spot where it falls until he has
picked it up; for this, once lost sight of, owing to the
sameness in the appearance of the reeds, is seldom
found again. In this manner the boat moves steadily
through and over the reeds, the birds flushing and
falling, the gunner loading and firing, while the
boatman is pushing and picking up. The sport continues
till an hour or two after high-water, when the
shallowness of the water, and the strength and weight
of the floating reeds, and also the backwardness
of the game to spring as the tide decreases, oblige
them to return. Several boats are sometimes within
a short distance of each other, and perpetual cracking
of musketry prevails along the whole reedy shores
of the river. In these excursions it is not uncommon
for an active and expert marksman to kill ten or
twelve dozen in a tide. They are usually shot
singly, though I have known five killed at one discharge
of a double-barreled piece. These instances
are rare. The flight of these birds among the reeds
is usually low; and shelter being abundant, is rarely
extended to more than fifty or one hundred yards.
When winged and uninjured in their legs, they swim
and dive with great rapidity, and are seldom seen to
rise again. I have several times on such occasions
discovered them clinging with their feet to the reeds
under the water; and at other times skulking under
the floating reeds with their bill just above the
surface. Sometimes, when wounded, they dive,
and rising under the gunwale of the boat, secrete
themselves there, moving round as the boat moves
until they have an opportunity of escaping unnoticed.
They are feeble and delicate in every thing but the
legs, which seem to possess great vigor and energy,
and their bodies being so remarkably thin or compressed
as to be less than an inch and a quarter
through transversely, they are enabled to pass between
the reeds like rats. Yet though their flight
among the reeds seems feeble and fluttering, every
sportsman who is acquainted with them here must
have seen them occasionally rising to a considerable
height, stretching out their legs behind them, and
flying rapidly across the river where it is more than
a mile in width."</p>

<h4>PURPLE GALLINULE. (<i>Gallinula Porphyrio.</i> <span class="smcap">Wilson.</span>)</h4>
<br />

<p>Before concluding this article, we would say a few
words in behalf of the Gallinule, called, from its resemblance
to the domestic fowl, the Water Hen. In
respect to manners, it is, according to Latham, a
very docile bird, being easily tamed and feeding
with the common poultry, scratching the ground with
the foot like the latter. It will feed on many things,
such as roots of plants, fruits, and grain, but will eat
fish with avidity, dipping them in the water before
it swallows them; will frequently stand on one leg
and lift the food to its mouth with the other, like a
parrot. Its flesh is exquisite in taste. This bird was
famous among the ancients under the name Porphyrion,
indicating the red or purple tint of its bill
and feet&mdash;a far more appropriate appellation than
that now vulgarly applied to it. It is known to breed
in Georgia, whose thick swamps favor the concealment
to which it is partial. It is extremely vigilant
and shy, and cannot be shot without great difficulty.
They move with grace upon the water, and run with
equal facility on the ground or on the leaves of
water plants.</p>

<h4>BY MISS ELLEN PICKERING.</h4>
<hr class="short" />

<p>"An humble appreciation of your powers might save you
pain; but I doubt if your humility exceeds your knowledge.
Fascinated by harmony of tone and grace of manner, you
perceive not a deficiency in energy&mdash;a want of moral
courage. You close your eyes against every token of an
over-sensitiveness to ridicule, veiled beneath the more
graceful cloak of fastidious taste. You will not understand
that pride and weakness fashion a character which, however
seemingly amiable in many other points, is not such
as to repay the devotion of a woman's love. A strong mind
will make itself known; and where all is perfect harmony,
no unmodulated tone, no sudden and impulsive movement,
no springing into action, there is art, and that may not be
trusted&mdash;or there is over-refinement, wasted powers, a
trivial mind, without a noble aim&mdash;or there is weakness,
which fears ridicule&mdash;a moral cowardice: or there is mediocrity,
that cannot rise above the common herd&mdash;that
dares not dare&mdash;that may pass unnoted in prosperity, but
whose powers rise not in adversity. Such should not be
throned in woman's heart! He is not worthy woman's
tender, self-denying love, whom a sneer will change&mdash;a
laugh will part&mdash;he will be found wanting&mdash;he will stand
aloof when the faint heart turns to him for consolation.
Wo to you! wo to you, especially if you trust such. You
cannot always tread on flowers; choose one who can and
will smooth down a rugged path. The gilded vessel, the
child's plaything, rides gayly on a glassy sea&mdash;but life is
not a glassy sea; the storm must come. If you would
reach the peaceful port, embark not in a summer yacht;
select a ship that can abide the storm&mdash;a mind that can
maintain its course&mdash;that struggles&mdash;and will conquer.
Look there," he continued, for she made no reply, taking
up a highly finished drawing from the table, the performance
showing more pains than genius, and contrasting it
with a bold, free sketch which lay beside it, "there they
are exactly, the one all harmony, or insipidity as I should
call it; a model of weakness&mdash;highly finished&mdash;not a stroke
wanting&mdash;complete as a whole&mdash;but how poor a whole!
Without the possibility of amendment, too: deficient in
energy&mdash;not a bold line: and were such put in it would be
out of place&mdash;it would spoil the keeping. Now look on
this! A bold and vigorous outline&mdash;the work of mind,
seizing the attention: soul, not manner; thought, not
mechanism; it may be filled up ill, but it may also be filled
up well: there is the capability of greatness: there may
be faults in the petty details, but the whole will compel
admiration, and not weary in the survey. This other
makes me yawn. Better choose the bold, the frank, the
generous, with all his faults; he may be rash, unthinking,
wasting the powers whose force he knows not; but the
capabilities of amendment are within him. What say you
to my exordium?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is great injustice to assert that delicacy of feeling is
confined to the higher ranks, and is the offspring of refinement
and education; these may nourish and increase, but
they cannot give it. It is innate; the child of the untutored
heart; the very essence of the beautiful: chained to
no climate, bounded to no rank.</p>

<p>We have seen the wealthy, those who thought themselves
the great ones of the earth, take leave of those of
fallen fortunes with undimmed eye and steady voice, as
though they knew not that there was cause for sorrow,
guessed not that the heart was well nigh broken, and only
stayed the expression of its grief that the cold gaze might
not mock it. We have seen the lowly ones of earth, lowly
in station, but how high in worth! part from the same;
and the lip could not speak for the heart's feeling; and the
tears of the mourner, repressed before lest the cold should
mock, mingled with theirs. The first passed on with stately
step, and a cold offer of future service; the last plucked
the only rose from the favorite tree, and placed it by the
traveler's cloak with a trembling hand and quivering lip.
They thought that the traveler would prize it as a memorial
of a once happy home. That single rose, and its kind
and delicate giver, can they ever be forgotten? If all the
memories of misfortune were like that who would not be
unfortunate? What feeling so endearing, so ennobling
as gratitude? Even love, though it may have more of
beauty and brightness, is not so generous and so pure.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What a glorious day! Not a heavy cloud in all the sky,
only a few fleecy forms floating across the rich blue vault,
and the sun shining out in all its summer splendor, as
though it had never shone before, looking down for the
first time on the gladsome earth, instead of having run its
course unnumbered years&mdash;undimmed in lustre&mdash;unimpaired
in power.</p>

<p>Where are the works of man? his labors of the past?
The eye looks on ruin; or time hath swept away even
that poor trace; and a fable or tradition alone remains.
But time hath no power over the Eternal or the works of
His hands&mdash;itself His slave.</p>

<p>Out! out! treading the green turf&mdash;lying on some
flowery bank&mdash;dreaming beneath the leafy shade. Who
would be pent up within four stone walls on such a day,
when he could forth with the blue above and the green
below, and a thousand gleesome things around? What
though the walls are gilded, and the lofty ceiling fretted;
the Persian carpet soft as the woodland moss; whilst the
luxuries of art, the beauties of genius, lend their splendors
with a gorgeous profusion? Still it is only a magnificent
prison. We see but little of the blue heaven; scarcely
more of the varied tints of earth. The air we breathe is
close; and the heart flutters to be free, as the imprisoned
butterfly on the first day of spring. Who would not rather
go forth into the fresh, free air, than be a prisoner even in
a gilded cage? And Nature, is she not more beautiful than
Art? Doth not that beauty make the step more buoyant,
and the heart more light?</p>

<p>How one loves a summer day with all its gentle glories
its murmured music&mdash;its delicious fragrance&mdash;its warmth,
gladdening, not oppressing, its soft and soothing air&mdash;its
dreamy feel, its shadows and its lights&mdash;its brilliant visions
and its stirring thoughts&mdash;and more, far more, its loving
memories!</p>

<h4>BY G. P. R. JAMES.</h4>


<p>It may seem perhaps a paradox to say that expectation
is enjoyment. Nevertheless it is so on this earth. Fruition
is for heaven. With the accomplishment of every desire
there is so much of disappointment mingled that it cannot
be really called enjoyment, for fancy always exercises itself
upon the future; and when we obtain the hard reality
for which we wished, the charms with which imagination
decorated it are gone. Did we but state the case to ourselves
as it truly is, whenever we conceive any of the
manifold desires which lead us on from step to step through
life, the proposition would be totally different from that
which man forever puts before his own mind, and we
should take one step toward undeceiving ourselves. We
continually say, "if I could attain such an object, I should
be <i>quite contented</i>." But what man ought to say to himself
is, "I believe this or that acquisition would give me
happiness." He would soon find that it did not do so; and
the never-ceasing recurrence of the lesson might, in the
end, teach him to ask what was the source of his disappointment?
Was it that other circumstances in his own
fate were so altered, even while he pursued the path of
endeavor, as to render attainment no longer satisfactory?&mdash;was
it that the object sought was intrinsically different
when attained, from that which he had reasonably believed
it to be while pursuing it?&mdash;or was it that his fancy had
gilded it with charms not its own, and that he had voluntarily
and blindly persuaded himself that it was brighter
and more excellent than it was? Perhaps the answer, yes,
might be returned to all these questions; but yet I fear the
chief burden of deceit would rest with imagination, and
that man would ever find he had judged of the future without
sufficient grounds, and had suffered desire to stimulate
hope, and hope to cheat expectation. Yet, perhaps, if he
would but turn back and look behind, when disappointment
and success had been obtained together, he would
find that the pleasures lasted in the pursuit, especially at
the time when fruition was drawing nearer and nearer,
would, in the sum, make up the amount of enjoyment
which he had anticipated in possession.</p>

<h5>SILENCE.</h5>


<p>What a strange power there is in <i>silence</i>! How many
resolutions are formed&mdash;how many sublime conquests
effected during that pause, when the lips are closed, and
the soul secretly feels the eye of her Maker upon her!
When some of those cutting, sharp, blighting words have
been spoken which send the hot indignant blood to the face
and head, if those to whom they are addressed keep silence,
look on with awe, for a mighty work is going on within
them, and the Spirit of Evil, or their Guardian Angel, is
very near to them in that hour. During that pause they
have made a step toward heaven or toward hell, and an
item has been scored in the book which the day of judgment
shall see opened. They are the strong ones of the
earth, the mighty for good or for evil, those who know
how to keep silence when it is a pain and a grief to them;
those who give time to their own souls, to wax strong
against temptation; or to the powers of wrath, to stamp
upon them their withering passage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Vanity Fair, a Novel without a Hero. By W. M. Thackeray.
New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 8vo.</i></p></div>

<p>This is one of the most striking novels of the season. It
bears little resemblance in tone, spirit and object, to the
other popular romances of the day. The author follows
in the track of Fielding rather than Bulwer, and aims at
representing the world as it is. Though his mind is not
creative, it is eminently delineative, and he has succeeded
in cramming into one volume a large variety of characters,
each expressing one of the different forms of worldliness,
and all belonging strictly to the world we live in. Though
the novel thus relates exclusively to the world, and indicates
a most remarkable knowledge of the selfish element
in human nature, in the multitudinous modifications which
that element receives from individual peculiarities, the
general tone of the author himself is so far from being
worldly, that it is distinguished by singular manliness,
cheerfulness and generosity. There is nothing morbid,
nothing of the hater or the sentimentalist in his representations.
He trusts himself resolutely to the genuine emotions of
the heart, but he guards himself against all superfine feelings
and manufactured sentiment. His characters are so true
that at first we are inclined to consider them commonplace.
In their development, however, we soon find that
the author is a master in his art, that without pretension
and without exaggeration, he touches profound springs of
thought and sentiment, and represents with a graceful
decision, and in clear light, those evanescent and unconscious
transpirations of character, in which a novelist's
capacity is most truly exhibited.</p>

<p>The animating spirit of the novel is that master-piece of
address and cunning, little Becky Sharp. Tact and talent
never had a worthier representative than this character.
She indicates the extreme point of worldly success to which
these qualities will carry a person, and also the impossibility
of their providing against all contingencies in life. Becky
steadily rises in the world, reaches a certain height, makes
one inevitable mistake, and then as steadily falls, while
many of her simple companions, whom she despises as
weaklings, succeed from the very simplicity with which
they follow the instinctive sagacity of pure and honest
feeling. Colonel Rawdon Crawley, a brainless sensualist,
whom Becky marries, and in some degree reforms, but who,
by having an occasional twinkle of genuine sentiment in
his heart, always was her superior, is drawn both with a
breadth and a nicety of touch which is rare in such delineations.
The exact amount of humanity which coexists
with his rascality and stupidity, is given with perfect accuracy.
Sir Pitt Crawley, coarse, uneducated, sordid, quarrelsome,
his small, sharp mind an epitome of vulgar shrewdness,
is a personation to force laughter from the lungs of a
misanthrope. Old Mr. Sedley is a most truthful representation
of a broken-down merchant, conceived in the spirit of
that humane humor which blends the ludicrous and the
pathetic in one. Joe Sedley, the East Indian, slightly suggests
Major Bagstock. He has the major's physical circumference,
apoplectic turn and swell of manner, with the
addition of Cockney vulgarity and cowardice. His retreat
from Brussels, just before the battle of Waterloo, is
described with the art of a comic Xenophan.</p>

<p>In the characters of George Osborne, Dobbin and Amelia,
the author has succeeded admirably. They are wonderfully
true to nature, and indicate even a finer power of
characterization than is exhibited in the more strongly
marked personages of the work.</p>

<p>The test of the excellence of a novel is the clearness
with which its events and characters are remembered after
it has been read. We think that Vanity Fair will bear this
criterion. All its characters are recognized in memory as
living beings, and we would refer to and quote them with
as much confidence as to any of the acquaintances we hold
in remembrance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Life, Letters and Literary Remains of John Keats. Edited
by Richard Moncton Milnes. New York: Geo. P. Putnam.
1 vol. 12mo.</i></p></div>

<p>This book, the long promised, has at last appeared, and
we must confess that, from the time expended in its preparation,
we expected a more satisfactory result. The
biography, though written in a style of elaborate elegance,
and pleasing enough as regards cadence of period and
felicity of phrase, tells little about Keats which is new, and
leaves many obscure passages of his life in the same darkness
in which it found them. Nothing to the purpose is
told of the lady who was the object of Keats's passionate
love, and who shares with consumption in being the
dismal cause of his early death. Mr. Milnes points triumphantly
to the new facts and private letters he has included
in the volume, in proof that the common impression that
Keats lacked manliness of character, is an error; but
instead of proving that Keats was a strong man, he has
very nearly proved that he himself is a sentimentalist.
The characteristic of Keats is sensitiveness to external
impressions, the characteristic of Milnes is sensitiveness to
self; the page of one throngs with delicious sensations, but
leaves no strong impression of character; that of the other
is pervaded by a thoughtful ennui, and leaves an impression
of egotistic weakness of character. Of course, Keats
is the stronger man of the two, and a stronger man even
than Milnes's musical sentences indicate, but still not a
strong man in the strict meaning of the phrase.</p>

<p>The letters of Keats are exceedingly interesting, and
some of them fine specimens of brilliant epistolary composition,
but we think there is a general tone of languid
jauntiness observable in them, which shows a certain
feebleness at the heart of his being. He seems a man
whom every one would desire to see placed in happy circumstances,
but not one who would bear bravely up under
bad circumstances. The state of his finances occupies a
good portion of his letters, and it is often very pleasantly
stated. As early as 1817, he speaks of receiving a note for
&pound;20, and avows his intention of destroying with it "some
of the minor heads of that hydra, the dun;" to conquer
which he says, the knight need have no sword or shield,
but only the "Bank-note of Faith and Cash of Salvation,
and set out against the monster invoking the aid of no
Archimago or Urganda, but finger me the paper, light as
the Sybil's leaves in Virgil, whereat the fiend skulks off
with his tail between his legs. . . I think," he adds, "I
could make a nice little allegorical poem, called "The
Dun," where we would have the Castle of Carelessness,
the Drawbridge of Credit, Sir Novelty Fashion's expedition
against the City of Tailors, &amp;c., &amp;c." There is a
good deal of this coquetry with indigence in the volume.</p>

<p>There is one curious letter to Reynolds, referring to
Wordsworth's calling the exquisite Hymn to Pan, in
"Endymion," "a pretty piece of Paganism." Keats took
the words in a contemptuous sense, and wrote a letter
from the feelings it excited, reminding us in its style of an
essay by Emerson. We extract it as almost the best thing
in the book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>


<p class="right"><i>Hampstead, February 3, 1818.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Reynolds</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your dish of
filberts. Would I could get a basket of them by way of
dessert every day for the sum of two pence, (two sonnets
on Robin Hood, sent by the two penny post.) Would we
were a sort of athereal pigs, and turned loose to feed upon
spiritual mast and acorns! which would be merely a
squirrel and feeding upon filberts; for what is a squirrel
but an airy pig, or a filbert but a sort of archangelical acorn?
About the nuts being worth cracking, all I can say is, that
where there are a throng of delightful images ready drawn,
simplicity is the only thing. It may be said that we ought
to read our contemporaries, that Wordsworth, &amp;c., should
have their due from us. But, for the sake of a few fine
imaginative or domestic passages, are we to be bullied into
a certain philosophy engendered in the whims of an
egotist? Every man has his speculations, but every man
does not brood and peacock over them till he makes a false
coinage and deceives himself. Many a man can travel
to the very bourne of Heaven, and yet want confidence to
put down his half-seeing. Sancho will invent a journey
heavenward as well as any body. We hate poetry that
has a palpable design upon us, and, if we do not agree,
seems to put its hand into its breeches pocket. Poetry
should be great and unobtrusive; a thing which enters
into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with
itself, but with its subject. How beautiful are the retired
flowers! How would they lose their beauty, were they
to throng into the highway, crying out "Admire me, I am
a violet! Dote upon me, I am a primrose!" Modern poets
differ from the Elizabethans in this; each of the moderns,
like an Elector of Hanover, governs his petty state, and
knows how many straws are swept daily from the causeways
in all his dominions, and has a continual itching that
all the housewives should have their coppers well scoured.
The ancients were emperors of vast provinces; they had
only heard of the remote ones, and scarcely cared to visit
them. I will cut all this. I will have no more of Wordsworth
or Hunt in particular. Why should we be of the
tribe of Manassah, when we can wander with Esau?
Why should we kick against the pricks when we can walk
on roses? Why should we be owls when we can be eagles?
Why be teazed with "nice-eyed wagtails," when we
have in sight "the cherub Contemplation?" Why, with
Wordsworth's "Matthew with a bough of wilding in his
hand," when we can have Jacques "under an oak," &amp;c.?
The secret of the "bough of wilding" will run through
your head faster than I can write it. Old Matthew spoke
to him some years ago on some nothing, and because he
happens in an evening walk to imagine the figure of the
old man, he must stamp it down in black and white, and
it is henceforth sacred. I don't mean to deny Wordsworth's
grandeur and Hunt's merit, but I mean to say we
need not be teazed with grandeur and merit when we can
have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive. Let us have the
old Poets and Robin Hood. Your letter and its sonnets gave
me more pleasure than will the Fourth Book of "Childe
Harold," and the whole of any body's life and opinions.</p>

<p>The reader rises from the biography of Keats with the
impression that it tells one of the most melancholy stories
in the history of literature. The account of his last days
is beyond measure painful. The poems now published for
the first time, though good enough to make a reputation,
will hardly add to the fame of Keats.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Women of the Revolution. By Elizabeth F. Ellet.
New York: Baker &amp; Scribner. 2 vols. 12mo.</i></p></div>

<p>We are under obligations to Mrs. Ellet for the two volumes
now before us. They are the first fruits of a large
harvest. And we doubt not that the authoress will pursue
the subject, and give "continuations," until something like
justice shall be done to the women, the mothers, sisters,
wives and sweethearts of the great and good men of our
Revolution. We wish that some just appreciation of what
all society owes woman could be had. We wish that some
one would sit down and show how all great efforts have
their origin in woman's devotion to her duty, and all
great men owe their position to their mother's faithful
service, and how society owes the advantages which it
may possess to the plastic mind of women. In this spirit
Mrs. Ellet has prepared the two volumes before us, and
has by her labors added one other name to the long list that
claims the gratitude of Americans. Of course when notices
of one hundred and twenty-four women are crowded
into two duodecimo volumes, no great extent can be
allowed to the biography of any one. Yet by a judicious
disposition of material, and selection of prominent places
for really prominent persons, Mrs. Ellet has given enough
to make her readers comprehend the character, services
and position of all her heroines. It happens to us to have
known something of the private life of several mentioned
in the volumes, and while we recollect much that is not
recorded, we are bound to confess that the character of
each so far as we know is well brought out, and additional
materials might serve only to sustain the opinion formed
by what is offered. We regard Mrs. Ellet's work only as
a prelude&mdash;a rich, delightful, prelude&mdash;but it must be followed
by other performances. The work is enriched with
the likenesses of several ladies whose biographies are given&mdash;one
or two of these we know are correct. The others
resemble what we recollect to have heard denominated
good likenesses.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Orators of the American Revolution. By E. L. Magoon.
New York: Baker &amp; Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</i></p></div>

<p>Mr. Magoon is a writer of great fluency and sensibility,
who "wreaks" his thoughts upon expression. He has
given us a very exciting volume, glowing with revolutionary
fervor, and eloquent of revolutionary heroes.
The great difficulty is that each of his orators is described
in terms which a cool person might hesitate in applying to
Demosthenes and Cicero. Mr. Magoon writes too much on
the high-pressure principle. As we move down the Mississippi
stream of his rhetoric, we are pleased with the
rapidity of the motion, and the chivalrous feeling of the
captain of the boat, but we look occasionally at the boiler
and the engine with some fear of an explosion.</p>

<p>Seriously, the volume will doubtless serve its purpose of
impressing a great idea of our revolutionary orators on the
popular mind&mdash;to reach which mind a certain extravagance
of statement and description is now considered necessary.
The glowing mode of writing history and biography is,
doubtless, better than the dry and dead mode, but a medium
between the two, combining life and movement with accuracy
and discrimination, is better still. However, we
know of no book on the subject so good as the present. It
can be read at one sitting, and it leaves a strong impression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
on the mind of the power of our great orators. Every
production which forcibly conveys an idea of our historical
men as living souls, as well as living names, deserves to
succeed.</p>

<p>This has been one of the most successful educational
books ever published. The present edition is from the
<i>eighty-fourth</i> London edition. The sale in England has
reached a hundred thousand copies. A mere glance at the
book will explain its popularity. It embraces the elements
of Mythology, Astronomy, Architecture, Heraldry, as well
as Ancient and Modern History, and gives exactly that
kind of information which every body needs. The first
principles and foundations of knowledge are often imperfectly
understood by persons moderately learned. Few
have any system in reading or study, but cram their minds
with miscellaneous matter of various kinds, without regard
to arrangement, and with no clear perception of the principles
of any thing. Such a book as the present is needed
not only by youth, but by many men and women who
would be offended at the charge of ignorance. No person
can read it without some addition to his knowledge. It is
got up with remarkable skill, and covers a very wide extent
of erudition.</p>

<h2>EDITOR'S TABLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Total Eclipse of the Moon.</span>&mdash;In the month of
September&mdash;the night of the 12th and 13th&mdash;there was a
total eclipse of the moon. Those who would know all
about it&mdash;exactly what was done when the adumbration
commenced, when and how long total obscuration was
observable, and when exactly the satellite passed out of
the shadow of her principal planet&mdash;have nothing to do
but read in the almanacs the predictions and calculations of
the event&mdash;for exactly to a second the whole was performed
as set down by the astronomers. It was a beautiful
sight for those who love to watch the phenomena of the
heavens, and there was not a cloud, not a passing scud, to
prevent a complete view of the whole movement, from the
first stain upon the eastern limb of the moon until the whole
passed off from her western side.</p>

<p>This eclipse of the moon is caused by that planet's passing
through the shadow of the earth, projected far into
space; and in proportion to the proximity of the moon
is the duration of the eclipse&mdash;so that we who occupied
the side of the earth to which the eclipse was visible, really
saw the moon darkened by the intervention of our own
shadow. How like life is this! How many thousands are
daily condemned for some apparent fault, which they have
indeed acquired from those who condemn. How many
live and suffer in the shadow of those who sneer&mdash;and persecute
while they impart the cause. How many parents,
by their errors, keep the sunlight of Truth and Religion
from their children, and yet condemn them for the shadow
which rests upon their mind, and makes them objects of undesirable
notoriety&mdash;profitless members of the social circle.</p>

<p>Go and inquire of that heart-broken, condemned female,
why she ceased to be the light of the circle in which she
was placed&mdash;and she will answer that the very beings
whom she was to bless, and from whom she was to derive
blessings, darkened her pathway by the interference of injudicious
kindness or ill-timed severity, and she became
totally eclipsed. Ask the youth who has just made shipwreck
of his wealth and his fame, and he will tell you that
in passing through the shadow which relatives and associates
had thrown across his path, his eclipse was so long
that society had no patience to await his return to light&mdash;no
mercy for the obscuration which their ill-timed lenity
to others had made him suffer.</p>

<p>But the moon on the morning of the 13th September
passed out of the obscuration, and went on her course diffusing
light to all, and maintaining her supremacy, in apparent
size and real lustre, above all the stellar orbs. And
thus it is with man. The shadow of misfortune or error,
of indiscretion, is always projected across his path&mdash;he is
liable with every change to suffer some obscuration, some
diminution of his brightness, some eclipse of that portion
bestowed on man. Let society wait&mdash;let him toil onward&mdash;let
there be a little faith, a little confidence, a little hope,
and he will recover all he has lost, he will emerge from
the shadow that is upon him and be bright and profitable as
before. In the deepest obscuration of the full, or the earthward
face of the moon, when all but its bare existence
seemed blotted out, the upper, heavenward surface was undimmed,
and reflected all the stellar glories of the higher
planets. And thus is it with man. Sorrows, disappointments,
errors, wrongs, darken his way, and all that is
visible to those around him seems sullied and obscure, and
he is left to toil onward through the deep shadow of misery
and shame&mdash;the earthward side of his heart in a total
eclipse&mdash;but the heavenward portion, the cherished and
the blessed, though beyond the gaze, and often beyond
the comprehension of the worldly&mdash;is bathed in the holy
light of heavenly influences&mdash;it knows no diminution of
brightness, no darkness from earthly shadows, no dimness
from worldly cares or worldly sorrow, but, turned away
from the observation and uses of mankind, its phaze is one
of unalterable quiet, of undimmed and shadowless lustre.
Earth is not permitted to project one shadow upon its
plane, while heaven and heavenly light lie beautiful and
beautifying upon its surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Women of the Scriptures.</span>&mdash;Our booksellers are
making judicious preparations for the approaching holydays,
and it may be anticipated that the next "Christmas times"
will afford a most varied and elegant assortment of gift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
books for the choice of purchasers. Among those that we
have been favored with a sight of, one of the most beautiful,
both in design and execution, is a volume entitled "<i>The
Women of the Scriptures</i>," which Messrs. <span class="smcap">Lindsay &amp;
Blakiston</span> have gotten up to correspond with those
favorite works "Scenes in the Life of the Saviour" and
"Scenes in the Lives of the Apostles," heretofore issued
by them. The new publication has been edited by the Rev.
<span class="smcap">H. Hastings Weld</span>, who has been well sustained by the
artists, printers and binders in their several departments.
The purchaser will find in this volume articles from many
of the most able and popular writers in the country, and
we are sure that it cannot fail to commend itself, in an
eminent degree, to the favor of the public.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Messrs. Carey &amp; Hart are about to publish an edition of
Mrs. Sigourney's poetry, to be illustrated by some of the
best productions of the American burin, samples of which
we have seen and admired. It is fitting that the writings
of Mrs. Sigourney should be thus set out.</p>

<p>The same publishers have caused to be prepared for the
festive season a handsome volume, of the Souvenir family,
called the Ruby. A portion, indeed most of its pictorial
embellishments are of the first class of engraving, and the
letter-press contains poetry and prose worthy of perusal.
The work is a beautiful addition to the centre-table, and
will of course find favor.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It is not Always Night.</span>"&mdash;The heart chilled by
adversity or languishing in sorrow, may find consolation
and peace in the thought which forms the caption of this

harmony of numbers by our contemporary, <span class="smcap">William C.
Richards</span>, Esq. Editor of the "Southern Literary Gazette."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Future.</span>&mdash;By the time another number of the
"Magazine" is laid before its numerous readers, the bustle
and din of the presidential election will have subsided, and
the people will set themselves to thinking seriously of the
selection of useful and entertaining publications, to render
perfect the enjoyment of the long, calm, quiet winter
evenings at home. Of course, none who take "Graham's
Magazine" now, will consent to deprive themselves of it
for the future, especially as the new volume, commencing
in January, will be rendered as attractive as means, energy,
industry and application can make it. We shall soon lay
before our hundred thousand readers our new Prospectus,
in which will be given a bird's-eye view of the plan of
our prospective operations. Nothing will be promised that
we will not fully and faithfully perform; and, unrivaled
as this "Magazine" has heretofore been, we intend so to
improve upon it, that the new volume shall bear away the
palm, and command the universal admission that it is more
excellent than ever!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Cheap Publications.</span>&mdash;In these days of cheap publications,
the means of gratifying a love for reading are within
the reach of all. There is an abundant supply to feed the
mental appetite, and our neighbor, <span class="smcap">T. B. Peterson</span>, caters
for the public taste with great energy and success. To the
lovers of light literature it may not be amiss for us to state,
that Mr. P. has published uniform editions of the works of
those popular and approved writers, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Grey</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss
Pickering</span>&mdash;ladies whose writings are always worth
reading, and always convey a good moral. A late publication,
"The Orphan Niece," by Miss Pickering, appears
now, for the first time in this country, and is as excellent
and interesting as those from the same pen with which the
public are more familiar.</p>

handsome compliments bestowed upon our Magazine by

We feel, however, rejoiced at and grateful for these evidences

yet more worthy of their commendations. The motto of
"Graham's Magazine" is <span class="smcap">Excelsior</span>; and as it has hitherto
stood immeasurably above all competitors in the public
estimation, so shall it maintain its enviable position, and

fully redeemed&mdash;more magnificent embellishments than any
literary work in the country has ever presented. This, of
course, will involve an immense expenditure of money, but
we never place cost in competition with the duty we owe
our patrons, and our desire to merit their favor.</p>

be pleased with the idea of so public an introduction to the
readers of this Magazine, but we know that he is a favorite
with them, and the admirers of his articles will be gratified
to see "what manner of man he is."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Winter Fashions.</span>&mdash;Our friend <i>Oakford</i> knows how to
cap the climax of human perfection, if we may judge from
the various styles and fashions of Hats, Caps, &amp;c., presented
in his card on the cover of our "Magazine." His
establishment is a favorite place of resort for all who desire
to be well fitted; and they must, indeed, be hard to please,
who cannot find something there to suit their fancy.</p>

might raise a high note of exultation upon the character
of the present number of the "American Monthly Magazine."
But, as "good wine needs no bush," we lay our
offering before the public, confident that its manifest excellence
will be discovered without the necessity of a word
from us to point out its varied beauties. While, however,
we believe, and feel assured that the public will concur in
the belief, that this number is one of surpassing beauty and
merit, it may not be improper to hint that the arrangements
we have consummated for the future, will enable us to
improve even upon our present high standard of excellence,
and keep us, as ever, far, very far in advance of the most
labored efforts of all contemporaries. Our course is onward,
and he must bestir himself actively who would excel
us.</p>
